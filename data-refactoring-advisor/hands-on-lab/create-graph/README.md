# Create Graph

Welcome to the wonderful world of [Oracle Graph Studio](https://www.oracle.com/database/integrated-graph-database/graph-faq/), where data relationships come to life in vibrant color! If you've ever found yourself tangled in a web of data, trying to make sense of connections and patterns, you're in for a treat. Oracle Graph Studio is here to transform that complexity into clarity, allowing you to create stunning graphs and perform insightful analyses with just a few clicks. 

Imagine being able to visualize your data as a network of nodes and edges, revealing hidden insights and relationships that traditional databases might keep under wraps. Whether you're a developer, analyst, or data scientist, Oracle Graph Studio simplifies the graph creation process, making it accessible to everyoneâ€”yes, even those who might not have a PhD in graph theory!

In this example, a graph will be created from the Nodes and Edges tables.

Login to Graph Studio from Database Actions

Define Graph

We will edit and update this model to add an edge and a vertex label.

The suggested model has the `NODES` as the vertex table since foreign key constraints are specified on `EDGES` that reference it.
And EDGES is a suggested edge table.

Click `Next` and Click `Create Graph`

![RunIt](../images/runIt.png)

Load the graph into memory to run algorithms and queries against it

Graph Studio will now save the metadata and start a job to create the graph.
The Jobs page shows the status of this job. Make sure that the status of all the jobs are Succeeded.
