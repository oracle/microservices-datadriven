# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Improve APISIX Eureka discovery resilience by configuring direct endpoints for all three Eureka replicas and increasing registry send and read timeouts.
- Keep Eureka Jetty connections open for 90 seconds by default, longer than APISIX/OpenResty's pooled connection lifetime, to avoid intermittent registry refresh failures caused by stale keepalive connections.
- Automatically register the required APISIX `opentelemetry` plugin_metadata via a sidecar container in the APISIX pod, eliminating the manual admin-API curl workaround and the recurring "plugin_metadata is required" warning.
