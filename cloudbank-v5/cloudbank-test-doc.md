# CloudBank Services Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through testing your secured CloudBank microservices deployment in an Oracle Backend as a Service (OBaaS) environment. You'll verify that the authorization server and protected services are functioning correctly, test the distributed transaction capabilities using Long Running Actions (LRA), and explore the observability features built into the platform.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning these tests, ensure you have:

- A running OBaaS environment with CloudBank services deployed
- `kubectl` command-line tool installed and configured
- `curl` command-line tool for making HTTP requests
- `jq` for parsing JSON responses
- Access to the Kubernetes cluster where CloudBank is deployed
- Access to the CloudBank OAuth client secrets created by `3-k8s_db_secrets.sh`
- The azn-server signing-key secret created by `3-k8s_db_secrets.sh`

## Step 1: Getting Started

### 1.1 Set Environment Variables

Set the namespace, OBaaS release, and database prefix used during installation:

```shell
export NAMESPACE=<namespace>
export OBAAS_RELEASE=<obaas-release>
export DB_NAME=<dbname>
```

Example:

```shell
export NAMESPACE=obaas-dev
export OBAAS_RELEASE=obaas
export DB_NAME=cbankdb
```

### 1.2 Retrieving the Gateway Address

First, obtain the APISIX gateway address. This address will be used as the base URL for all API requests.

**1.2.1 Get the APISIX gateway service:**

This works in local and non-ingress environments:

Run the following command:

   ```shell
   kubectl get svc -n $NAMESPACE | grep apisix-gateway
   ```

If the service has an external address, set:

   ```shell
   export IP=<external-ip-or-host>
   ```

For local testing, use a port-forward:

   ```shell
   kubectl port-forward -n $NAMESPACE svc/$OBAAS_RELEASE-apisix-gateway 8080:80
   ```

Then in another terminal:

   ```shell
   export IP=localhost:8080
   ```

**1.2.2 OCI ingress option:**

If your environment exposes APISIX through an ingress, you can use:

   ```shell
   kubectl get ingress -n $NAMESPACE
   export IP=$(kubectl get ingress $OBAAS_RELEASE-apisix -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
   ```

### 1.3 Get Access Tokens

Protected CloudBank APIs require OAuth2 bearer tokens from `azn-server`. Use `http://localhost` only with a local port-forward; use HTTPS for any external gateway URL so client secrets and tokens are not sent over plaintext network links.

```shell
export CLIENT_ID=cloudbank-client
export CLIENT_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret $DB_NAME-azn-server-auth -n $NAMESPACE \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d)
export TEST_CLIENT_ID=cloudbank-test-client
export TEST_CLIENT_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret $DB_NAME-azn-server-auth -n $NAMESPACE \
  -o jsonpath='{.data.test-client-secret}' | base64 -d)

export READ_TOKEN=$(curl -s -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -X POST "http://$IP/oauth2/token" \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d scope=cloudbank.read | jq -r .access_token)

export WRITE_TOKEN=$(curl -s -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -X POST "http://$IP/oauth2/token" \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d scope="cloudbank.read cloudbank.write" | jq -r .access_token)

export TEST_TOKEN=$(curl -s -u "$TEST_CLIENT_ID:$TEST_CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -X POST "http://$IP/oauth2/token" \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d scope=cloudbank.test | jq -r .access_token)

export TRANSFER_TOKEN=$(curl -s -u "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" \
  -X POST "http://$IP/oauth2/token" \
  -d grant_type=client_credentials \
  -d scope=cloudbank.transfer | jq -r .access_token)
```

Verify the authorization server metadata endpoint is public:

```shell
curl -s http://$IP/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server | jq
curl -s http://$IP/oauth2/jwks | jq '.keys[].kid'
```

---

## Step 2: Testing Core Services

All API calls in this section go through APISIX and the Spring resource servers. A request without a bearer token should be rejected:

```shell
curl -i http://$IP/api/v1/creditscore
```

Expected result: HTTP `401 Unauthorized`.

### 2.1 Account Service

The Account service manages customer bank accounts including checking and credit card accounts.

**2.1.1 Test the REST Endpoint:**

Execute the following command to retrieve all accounts:

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/accounts | jq
```

Choose two valid account IDs from this response for later deposit and transfer tests:

```shell
FROM_ACCOUNT_ID=<account-id-with-positive-balance>
TO_ACCOUNT_ID=<another-account-id>
```

**2.1.2 Verify the Response:**

You should receive a JSON array containing account objects. Each account includes details such as account ID, customer ID, account type, balance, and opening date:

```json
[
  {
    "accountBalance": -20,
    "accountCustomerId": "qwertysdwr",
    "accountId": 1,
    "accountName": "Andy's checking",
    "accountOpenedDate": "2023-06-26T17:39:37.000+00:00",
    "accountOtherDetails": "Account Info",
    "accountType": "CH"
  },
  {
    "accountBalance": 1000,
    "accountCustomerId": "bkzLp8cozi",
    "accountId": 2,
    "accountName": "Mark's CCard",
    "accountOpenedDate": "2023-11-02T17:23:53.000+00:00",
    "accountOtherDetails": "Mastercard account",
    "accountType": "CC"
  }
]
```

**Note:** Account types include "CH" for checking accounts and "CC" for credit card accounts.

---

### 2.2 Customer Service

The Customer service handles customer information and profile management.

**2.2.1 Retrieve All Customers:**

To view all customers in the system:

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/customer | jq
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
[
  {
    "customerEmail": "andy@andy.com",
    "customerId": "qwertysdwr",
    "customerName": "Andy",
    "customerOtherDetails": "Somekind of Info",
    "dateBecameCustomer": "2023-11-02T17:30:12.000+00:00"
  }
]
```

**2.2.2 Create a New Customer:**

To create a new customer, send a POST request with customer details:

```shell
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WRITE_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"customerId": "bobsmith", "customerName": "Bob Smith", "customerEmail": "bob@smith.com"}' \
  http://$IP/api/v1/customer
```

**Expected Response:**

A successful creation returns HTTP status 201 with a Location header pointing to the newly created resource:

```text
HTTP/1.1 201
Location: http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customer/bobsmith
Content-Length: 0
Date: Tue, 03 Sep 2024 21:01:25 GMT
```

---

### 2.3 Credit Score Service

The Credit Score service provides credit scoring information for customers.

**2.3.1 Check Credit Score:**

Retrieve the current credit score data:

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/creditscore | jq
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "Date": "2023-12-26",
  "Credit Score": "574"
}
```

---

### 2.4 Check Processing Service

The Check service handles check deposits and clearances through a multi-step workflow involving journal entries.

**2.4.1 Deposit a Check:**

Initiate a check deposit for an existing account:

```shell
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_TOKEN" \
  -d "{\"accountId\": ${TO_ACCOUNT_ID}, \"amount\": 256}" \
  http://$IP/api/v1/testrunner/deposit
```

**Important:** Set `TO_ACCOUNT_ID` to an actual account ID from your environment.

**Expected Response:**

```text
HTTP/1.1 201
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Thu, 02 Nov 2023 18:02:06 GMT

{"accountId":1,"amount":256}
```

**2.4.2 Verify Check Service Logs:**

Confirm the deposit was received by checking the service logs:

```shell
kubectl logs -n $NAMESPACE svc/checks
```

**Expected Log Entry:**

```log
Received deposit <CheckDeposit(accountId=1, amount=256)>
```

**2.4.3 Check Journal Entries:**

View the journal entries for the account to see the pending deposit:

```shell
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/account/${TO_ACCOUNT_ID}/journal
```

Replace `TO_ACCOUNT_ID` with your account number if you are not using the shell variable.

**Expected Response:**

```text
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Thu, 02 Nov 2023 18:06:45 GMT

[{"journalId":1,"journalType":"PENDING","accountId":1,"lraId":"0","lraState":null,"journalAmount":256}]
```

**Note:** The journal type is "PENDING" at this stage, indicating the check has not yet cleared.

**2.4.4 Clear the Check:**

Process the check clearance using the journal ID from the previous step:

```shell
curl -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"journalId": 1}' \
  http://$IP/api/v1/testrunner/clear
```

Replace `1` with the actual journal ID.

**Expected Response:**

```text
HTTP/1.1 201
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Thu, 02 Nov 2023 18:09:17 GMT

{"journalId":1}
```

**2.4.5 Verify Clearance in Logs:**

Check the service logs again to confirm clearance was processed:

```shell
kubectl logs -n $NAMESPACE svc/checks
```

**Expected Log Entry:**

```log
Received clearance <Clearance(journalId=1)>
```

**2.4.6 Verify Final Journal Entry:**

Check the journal entries again to confirm the deposit has been completed:

```shell
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/account/${TO_ACCOUNT_ID}/journal
```

**Expected Response:**

```text
HTTP/1.1 200
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Thu, 02 Nov 2023 18:36:31 GMT

[{"journalId":1,"journalType":"DEPOSIT","accountId":1,"lraId":"0","lraState":null,"journalAmount":256}]
```

**Note:** The journal type has changed from "PENDING" to "DEPOSIT", indicating successful clearance.

---

## Step 3: Testing Long Running Actions (LRA)

Long Running Actions provide distributed transaction coordination across microservices. This test demonstrates a fund transfer between two accounts using the LRA pattern.

### 3.1 Check Initial Account Balances

Before performing the transfer, record the initial balances of both accounts:

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/account/${TO_ACCOUNT_ID} | jq
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/account/${FROM_ACCOUNT_ID} | jq
```

**Note:** Account numbers may differ in your environment. Adjust the account IDs as needed.

**Example Output:**

```json
{
  "accountId": 1,
  "accountName": "Andy's checking",
  "accountType": "CH",
  "accountCustomerId": "qwertysdwr",
  "accountOpenedDate": "2023-11-02T17:23:53.000+00:00",
  "accountOtherDetails": "Account Info",
  "accountBalance": -20
}
```

```json
{
  "accountId": 2,
  "accountName": "Mark's CCard",
  "accountType": "CC",
  "accountCustomerId": "bkzLp8cozi",
  "accountOpenedDate": "2023-11-02T17:23:53.000+00:00",
  "accountOtherDetails": "Mastercard account",
  "accountBalance": 1000
}
```

### 3.2 Perform the Transfer

Execute a transfer of funds from one account to another:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TRANSFER_TOKEN" \
  "http://$IP/transfer?fromAccount=${FROM_ACCOUNT_ID}&toAccount=${TO_ACCOUNT_ID}&amount=100"
```

Adjust the account IDs and amount as needed.

**Expected Response:**

```text
transfer status:withdraw succeeded deposit succeeded
```

This indicates that both the withdrawal from the source account and the deposit to the destination account completed successfully.

### 3.3 Verify Account Balances

Check both accounts again to confirm the transfer was applied correctly:

```shell
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/account/${TO_ACCOUNT_ID} | jq
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $READ_TOKEN" http://$IP/api/v1/account/${FROM_ACCOUNT_ID} | jq
```

**Expected Output:**

Account 1 balance should have increased by 100:

```json
{
  "accountId": 1,
  "accountName": "Andy's checking",
  "accountType": "CH",
  "accountCustomerId": "qwertysdwr",
  "accountOpenedDate": "2023-11-02T17:23:53.000+00:00",
  "accountOtherDetails": "Account Info",
  "accountBalance": 80
}
```

Account 2 balance should have decreased by 100:

```json
{
  "accountId": 2,
  "accountName": "Mark's CCard",
  "accountType": "CC",
  "accountCustomerId": "bkzLp8cozi",
  "accountOpenedDate": "2023-11-02T17:23:53.000+00:00",
  "accountOtherDetails": "Mastercard account",
  "accountBalance": 900
}
```

### 3.4 Review Transfer Service Logs

Examine the detailed LRA coordination logs:

```shell
kubectl logs -n $NAMESPACE svc/transfer
```

**Expected Log Output:**

```text
2023-12-26T16:50:45.138Z  INFO 1 --- [transfer] [nio-8080-exec-9] [] com.example.transfer.TransferService     : Started new LRA/transfer Id: http://otmm-tcs.otmm.svc.cluster.local:9000/api/v1/lra-coordinator/ea98ebae-2358-4dd1-9d7c-09f4550d7567

## Step 4: Observability and Monitoring

OBaaS includes several built-in observability tools to help you monitor and troubleshoot your microservices. CloudBank uses the OBaaS 2.1.0 Java auto-instrumentation model; the Java agent is injected by the platform instead of being packaged as application tracing/exporter dependencies.

### 4.1 Eureka Service Registry

Eureka provides service discovery, showing all registered microservices.

**4.1.1 Create a Port Forward:**

Create a port forward to the Eureka service:

```shell
kubectl -n $NAMESPACE port-forward svc/eureka 8761
```

**4.1.2 Access the Dashboard:**

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8761
```

**4.1.3 Verify Service Registration:**

The dashboard displays all registered services, their health status, and instance information. Verify that all CloudBank services (`azn-server`, account, customer, checks, creditscore, testrunner, and transfer) appear in the registry.

---

### 4.2 Spring Boot Admin Server

The Admin Server provides detailed management and monitoring capabilities for Spring Boot applications.

**4.2.1 Create a Port Forward:**

Create a port forward to the Admin Server:

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n $NAMESPACE svc/$OBAAS_RELEASE-admin-server 8989
```

**4.2.2 Access the Dashboard:**

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8989
```

**4.2.3 Explore Service Metrics:**

The dashboard shows detailed metrics, health checks, environment properties, and logging information for each registered service.

---

### 4.3 SigNoz - Distributed Tracing and Observability

SigNoz provides comprehensive observability including distributed tracing, metrics, and log aggregation.

**4.3.1 Retrieve Admin Credentials:**

Get the admin email and password:

```shell
kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get secret signoz-authn -o jsonpath='{.data.email}' | base64 -d
kubectl -n $NAMESPACE get secret signoz-authn -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 -d
```

**4.3.2 Create a Port Forward:**

Create a port forward to the SigNoz frontend:

```shell
kubectl -n $NAMESPACE port-forward svc/$OBAAS_RELEASE-signoz 8080:8080
```

**4.3.3 Access the Login Page:**

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080/login
```

Log in using the email and password retrieved in step 4.3.1.

**4.3.4 Explore Pre-installed Dashboards:**

Navigate through the pre-configured dashboards to view system metrics, service performance, and infrastructure health.

**4.3.5 View Distributed Traces:**

To explore distributed traces:

1. Click on the "Traces" section in the navigation menu
2. Select the `customer` service from the service dropdown to view traces related to customer operations
3. Click on any trace to expand and view detailed timing information across all involved services
4. Use the trace visualization to identify performance bottlenecks and understand request flow

**4.3.6 Browse Application Logs:**

To view application logs:

1. Click on the "Logs" section in the navigation menu
2. Select the `customer` service from the service dropdown
3. Browse through application logs with full context and filtering capabilities
4. Click on any log line to expand and view complete details including trace correlation

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Service Not Responding:** Check that all pods are running using `kubectl get pods -n $NAMESPACE`
- **Connection Refused:** Verify the external IP is correct and accessible
- **401/403 Errors:** Ensure you're using a bearer token with the required scope for the route
- **Transaction Failures:** Review service logs for detailed error messages
- **Port Forward Issues:** Ensure no other process is using the specified port

---
