The On-Premises installation includes both a Desktop installation and an Estate installation.\nThe Desktop installation can be used to explore the in a non-Production environment, while the Estate installation is targeted for Production infrastructure.\nPrerequisites You must meet the following prerequisites to use the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot On-Premises:\nAccess to an Oracle Database - Enterprise Edition 21.3.0.0 Access to a Container Repository Access to a Kubernetes Cluster Python 3+ When installing on a Desktop the above pre-requisites are met through an additional Setup task, but there are additional desktop system/software requirements:\n2 CPUs or more 8GB of free memory 60GB of free disk space (40G minikube and container images, 20G database) Internet connection Minikube Podman1 Oracle SSO Account to download the database image Download Download Oracle Backend for Spring Boot.\nSetup An On-Premises installation, whether Desktop or Estate, consists of defining the Infrastructure followed by running the Configuration Management Playbook to build images and deploy the microservices.\nFor an Estate installation, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.\nA helper Playbook has been provided for the Desktop installations to assist in defining the Infrastructure. Please review the appropriate documentation for examples of installing and defining the Desktop installation (more Desktop examples may be provided in the future).\nMacOS Ventura (x86) Oracle Linux 8 (x86) The Desktop Playbook will be run as part of the Configuration Management.\nDownload the Database/ORDS Images (Desktop Installation) The Desktop installation will provision an Oracle Database into the Kubernetes cluster. The images must be downloaded from Oracle\u0026rsquo;s Container Registry prior to continuing.\nAfter Installing Podman:\nLog into Oracle\u0026rsquo;s Container Registry: podman login container-registry.oracle.com Pull the Database Image: podman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:21.3.0.0 Pull the ORDS Image: podman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/ords:21.4.2-gh Defining the Database (Estate Installation) The database is defined in ansible/roles/database/vars/main.yaml. Below is an example definition:\n--- oracle_dbs: [\u0026#39;BAASPDB\u0026#39;] default_db: BAASPDB BAASPDB: username: \u0026#39;PDBADMIN\u0026#39; password: \u0026#39;Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35\u0026#39; service: \u0026#39;(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=BAASPDB)))\u0026#39; ocid: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; ... The oracle_dbs and default_db key values should be the name of your Pluggable Database (PDB). These are followed by the PDB Name and key/values defining how to access the PDB. If using mTLS authentication, specify the full path of the wallet file.\nDefining the Container Repository (Estate Installation) The container repository is defined in ansible/roles/registry/vars/main.yaml. Below is an example definition:\n--- registry_username: \u0026#39;oracle\u0026#39; registry_password: \u0026#39;Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35\u0026#39; push_registry_url: \u0026#39;docker.io/myorg\u0026#39; push_registry_auth: auths: docker.io/myorg: auth: \u0026#39;b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0\u0026#39; pull_registry_url: \u0026#39;docker.io/myorg\u0026#39; pull_registry_auth: auths: docker.io/myorg: auth: \u0026#39;b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0\u0026#39; ...

The pull URL is used inside the pods while the push is used from the deployment machine. If you have a private registry inside the Kubernetes cluster, these URL\u0026rsquo;s could be different. This is the case for the Desktop installation; the push URL is localhost:5000, while the pull URL is \u0026lt;Registry Pod ClusterIP\u0026gt;:5000.\nConfiguration Management From the source package, run the configuration management Playbook:\nInstall Ansible Using python, install Ansible to run the Configuration Management Playbook. The helper scripts will create a Python Virtual Environment and install Ansible and additional modules:\n./setup_ansible.sh source ./activate.env Desktop Playbook If this is an Estate installation, the Infrastructure should be manually defined as per above.\nIf this is a Desktop installation; run the helper Playbook to define the infrastructure:\nansible-playbook ansible/desktop-apply.yaml Build and Push Images to the Container Repository For the Desktop installation, start a new terminal and tunnel or port-forward to the minikube cluster.

For Eureka, the service name is the key used to deploy the service in Eureka, which is normally the value from spring.application.name in the Spring Boot configuration file (src/main/resources/application.yaml), in upper case. For Kubernetes, the service name is in the format namespace/service:port where namespace is the Kubernetes namespace in which the Spring Boot application is deployed, service is the name of the Kubernetes Service for that application, and port is the name of the port in that service. If you deployed your Spring Boot application with the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot CLI, the port name will be spring.

You could set the full path of another Kubernetes config file. If the file is correctly loaded, the plugin will show the list of contexts available in which select one:\nIn positive case, you should see a tree view with one node and the context chosen:\nIf the file path it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been correctly set, it will shown an error message:\nTo restart the plugin and proceed again in Kubernetes config file setting, in command palette execute a window reload:\nHow to access to cluster Until you create a dedicated ssh tunnel to the Kubernetes cluster, and you don\u0026rsquo;t connect to Oracle Backend for Spring Boot admin services, you will not be able to browse resources included into the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot deployment.

VS Code will open a new terminal that will try to open a tunnel to the Kubernetes cluster on a local port, starting from 8081:\nBefore proceed to connection, please wait until the tunnel is established and the terminal shows a message like this:\nNOTE: if the K8s cluster it\u0026rsquo;s not related to an Oracle Backend for Spring Boot deployment, the tunnel creation will fail. In this case in command palette execute a window reload to chose another cluster. If you have any problem in connection, you could start another tunnel: the plugin will try on another local port to connect to the cluster.\nAgain select the cluster and by clicking the right mouse button choose Connect menu item. This will create a session with credentials set at the first step.\nExplore resources As soon as completed the steps to create tunnel and you get connected to the backend, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to expand or refresh the tree related to the deployment.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see four top classes of resources that can be exploded in underlying items:\napplications: the list of applications deployed and the services holding ADB: in this release we have one ADB in which are stored configuration and schema related to services deployed platformServices: the list of Oracle Backend for Spring Boot deployed services, like Grafana, Spring, Apisix, Eureka and Jaeger. oBaasConf: the list of keys defined by application, stored in the ADB provisioned and available to share configuration information among services in each application. Let\u0026rsquo;s go to show the operations you can do on each item of browse tree.\nApplications Open the list clicking on the arrow at the left of applications:\nand then expand the application about you want to know which services includes:\nAt root level, by clicking the right mouse button on applications leaf, chose Add application to create a new application. On VS Code Command Palette will appear the prompt to set the application name it will be created:\nTo show the list updated, click on the Refresh icon on right side of applications item.\nOn each application, you can Add service -\u0026gt; upload .jar or Delete Application.\nAdd Service The Add Service command imply the upload of a Spring Boot microservice in an Application context. Clicking Add service -\u0026gt; upload .jar menu item on a specific application:\nin the VS Code Command Palette prompt will be required the parameters needed, in this order:\nA popup will be opened to select the local Spring Boot .jar file\nif you need to bind the service to an user/schema in DB:\nService Name\nDB User Password you have to set only if you have chosen to bind a schema on DB the service you are deploying:\nSpring Binding prefix (Default: spring.datasource)\nImage Version (Default: 0.1)\nJava image (Default: ghcr.io/graalvm/jdk:ol7-java17-22.2.0)\nRedeploy (Default: false)\nAdd Health probe (Default: false)\nService Port (Default: 8080)\nService Profile (Default: obaas)\nAt the end of parameters collection, it will be started the binding and upload process that will generate a sequence of messages showing the status. These messages will end with \u0026ldquo;Service deployed successfully!\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Deploy failed\u0026rdquo;. According to the size and network constraints, the process will take more or less time to terminate.\nDelete Service You can delete an existing service or one you have deployed from VS Code extension. In either cases, you have to select the service and click the right mouse button to select the only command available, i.e. Delete service. Also in this case, you should refresh the tree at application level to have an updated view and, sometimes, more than one time.\nDelete Application This command will remove the application and all the services included. At the end of process it will be shown a message \u0026ldquo;Delete successful\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Delete application failed!\u0026rdquo;. After that you can refresh the tree, at single application level and then at applications level. Take in consideration that the termination of pods and application isn\u0026rsquo;t synchronous operation: so it could happen you have to refresh more than one times to have a clean view.\nADB database For each Oracle Backend for Spring Boot is provisioned an Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing Database to hold the schema related to the Spring Boot services and configuration details. To store the Admin DB Password you can click the wheel shown next to the ADB database item. In the VS Code Command Palette will be prompted the password:\nplatformServices This leaf of tree can be expanded to show the services available in the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot platform. For each of them, by clicking the right mouse button on the leaf you can open an ssh tunnel to the service on a specific local port automatically chosen. At the end, it will prompted a link to open in the default web browser the admin console of each platform services. For example, by clicking the right mouse button on grafana console:\nit will be opened a tunnel and a message with a button opening a web browser on the admin Grafana\u0026rsquo;s console will be shown:\nNOTE: if something goes wrong, like port already used or a timeout opening the connection, you can open another ssh tunnel: it will be automatically opened on another port.\noBaasConf Oracle Backend for Spring Boot offers to developers a store for the metadata and configurations useful to share info among pods in an application. The VS Code plug-in can browse the content of this key-value store, add, update and delete keys according the needs. Expanding the leaf oBaasConf you will see the applications deployed and, expanding each of them, the key-value pair, as shown in the following pictures:\nMoving mouse on each key-value pair, you can see the other metadata related to the key, profile and label. In the following picture, the key spring.datasource.url with value \u0026lsquo;jdbc:oracle:thin:@$\u0026hellip;.\u0026rsquo; has the property application coming from the root, i.e. cloudbank, profile=1.0 and label=kube.\nThe operation that can be done are:\nAdd key: by clicking the right mouse button on an oBaasConf or service-conf item, in the VS Code Command Palette will be requested:\nService name\nLabel\nProfile\nPropKey\nValue\nNOTE: you can add a config properties also for a Service not yet deployed. In some case it is mandatory to prepare properties before deploy services in order to correctly startup them.\nEdit key: by clicking the right mouse button on a selected key, in the VS Code Command Palette will be requested to update the current content Value\nDelete key: by clicking the right mouse button on a selected key, it will possible delete it.\n","description":"Developer Preview 0.3.7 - April, 2023\nOracle Backend for Spring Boot VS Code plugin is an extension to browse and deploy applications on the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot platform.

Setup Information Vault uses the following Oracle OCI Services:\nObject Storage for storing Vault data OCI Vault to auto unseal the Vault Container Engine for Kubernetes for running the Vault server The Vault is unsealed using the OCI KMS key. The root token is provided during deployment of Oracle Backend as a Service for Spring Cloud.\nThe following Vault services are enabled during deployment. Other services can be enabled using the vault command and the Web User Interface.\nToken Auth Method. The token auth method is built-in and automatically available. It allows users to authenticate using a token, as well to create new tokens, revoke secrets by token, and more. AppRole Auth Method. The approle auth method allows machines or apps to authenticate with Vault-defined roles. Kubernetes Auth Method. The kubernetes auth method can be used to authenticate with Vault using a Kubernetes Service Account Token. This method of authentication makes it easy to introduce a Vault token into a Kubernetes Pod. Userpass Auth MethodThe userpass auth method allows users to authenticate with Vault using a username and password combination. KV Secrets Engine Version 2. The kv secrets engine is a generic Key-Value store used to store arbitrary secrets. Accessing Vault using using kubectl To access Vault using kubectl you need to setup Kubernetes Access\nTest access to Vault\nVault Documentation contains all the commands you can use with the Vault CLI. For example this command returns the current status of Vault:\nkubectl exec pod/vault-0 -n vault -it -- vault status The output will be similar to this:\nKey Value --- ----- Recovery Seal Type shamir Initialized true Sealed false Total Recovery Shares 5 Threshold 3 Version 1.11.3 Build Date 2022-08-26T10:27:10Z Storage Type oci Cluster Name vault-cluster-28535f69 Cluster ID 993662ee-b3ee-2a13-3354-97adae01e1ca HA Enabled true HA Cluster https://vault-0.vault-internal:8201 HA Mode active Active Since 2023-01-26T16:14:32.628291153Z Login into Vault\nTo interact with vault you need to login using a token.
