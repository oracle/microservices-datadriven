This version includes an Oracle Database storage adapter for Parse (Parse already has MongoDB and Postgres adapters), and a proof of concept of Google Firebase APIs emulated using Parse APIs.\nThe Oracle Backend for Parse Platform is based on the Parse Platform.\nIn addition to an Oracle Autonomus Database Shared instance, the following software components are deployed in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) for customer usage with Oracle Backend for Parse Platform:\nParse Server, plus the Oracle Database storage adapter for Parse Parse Dashboard Interested in Spring Boot or microservices too? Check out Oracle Backend for Spring Boot Developer Preview This release is a Developer Preview. This means that not all functionality is complete. In this release, approximately 80-900% of the Parse APIs are working. For interested developers, approximately 2270 of 2700 tests run successfully. This release is based on Parse Server version 5.2.7 and Parse Dashboard 5.0.0. We are releasing this as a developer preview to allow interested developers to try it and give feedback.\nThe following API families are mostly working:\nDatabase, including query Identity/Security File Caching GeoPoints Config Data The following API families are not expected to work in this release:\nCloud Functions GraphQL Live Query Push Notifications The Parse API exposed is exactly the same as an upstream Parse Server (version 5.2.7) - there are no changes to the public facing API. All existing Parse SDKs should work as-is with this developer preview (for those APIs that are working).\nAbout the Oracle Database storage adapter for Parse This developer preview includes an Oracle Database storage adapter for Parse based on the Parse Server 5.2.7 code line. The storage adapter is implemented using the Node.js node-oracledb library. Data are stored in the database in JSON collections, using the Simple Oracle Document Access (SODA) API.\n","description":"Oracle Backend for Parse Platform - Developer Preview Oracle Backend for Parse Platform allows developers to build and deploy mobile applications using Parse mobile APIs, and provision a backend as a service with the Oracle Database and other infrastructure components that operate on multiple clouds.

The On-Premises installation includes both a Desktop installation and an Estate installation.\nThe Desktop installation can be used to explore the in a non-Production environment, while the Estate installation is targeted for Production infrastructure.\nPrerequisites You must meet the following prerequisites to use the Oracle Backend for Parse Platform On-Premises:\nAccess to an Oracle Database - Enterprise Edition 21.3.0.0 Access to a Container Repository Access to a Kubernetes Cluster Python 3+ When installing on a Desktop the above pre-requisites are met through an additional Setup task, but there are additional desktop system/software requirements:\n2 CPUs or more 8GB of free memory 60GB of free disk space (40G minikube and container images, 20G database) Internet connection Minikube Podman1 Oracle SSO Account to download the database image Download Download Oracle Backend for Parse Platform.\nSetup An On-Premises installation, whether Desktop or Estate, consists of defining the Parse Application and infrastructure; followed by running the Configuration Management Playbook to build images and deploy the microservices.\nFor an Estate installation, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.\nA helper Playbook has been provided for Desktop installations to assist in defining the Infrastructure. Please review the appropriate documentation for examples of installing and defining the Desktop installation (more Desktop examples may be provided in the future).\nMacOS Ventura (x86) Oracle Linux 8 (x86) The Desktop Playbook will be run as part of the Configuration Management.\nDownload the Database/ORDS Images (Desktop Installation) The Desktop installation will provision an Oracle Database into the Kubernetes cluster. The images must be downloaded from Oracle\u0026rsquo;s Container Registry prior to continuing.\nAfter Installing Podman:\nLog into Oracle\u0026rsquo;s Container Registry: podman login container-registry.oracle.com Pull the Database Image: podman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:21.3.0.0 Pull the ORDS Image: podman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/ords:21.4.2-gh Defining the Parse Application (Estate Installation) The Parse Application is defined in ansible/vars/baas.yaml. Below is an example definition:\n--- app_name: \u0026#34;MYAPP\u0026#34; app_id: \u0026#34;PiITzsu3RCc499RRDOYOBgWnyAlMm6695r1536y1\u0026#34; master_key: \u0026#34;Q5CP7MHpoZhSwbk39XpHxamp4rJJ4F3vPZ3NZ7ee\u0026#34; dashboard_username: \u0026#34;ADMIN\u0026#34; dashboard_password: \u0026#34;OZ0-mSt-27Evb-Qy\u0026#34; storage: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; access_key: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; private_key: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; ... You can use any arbitrary string as your app_name, app_id and master_key. These will be used by your clients to authenticate with the Parse Server. It is recommended to specify a unique dashboard_username and dashboard_password.\nDefining the Database (Estate Installation) The database is defined in ansible/roles/database/vars/main.yaml. Below is an example definition:\n--- oracle_dbs: [\u0026#39;BAASPDB\u0026#39;] default_db: BAASPDB BAASPDB: username: \u0026#39;PDBADMIN\u0026#39; password: \u0026#39;Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35\u0026#39; service: \u0026#39;(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=BAASPDB)))\u0026#39; ocid: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; ... The oracle_dbs and default_db keys should be the name of your Pluggable Database (PDB). These keys are followed by the PDB and keys defining how to access the PDB. If using mTLS authentication, specify the full path of the wallet file.\nDefining the Container Repository (Estate Installation) The container repository is defined in ansible/roles/registry/vars/main.yaml. Below is an example definition:\n--- compartment_ocid: \u0026#39;\u0026#39; registry_username: \u0026#39;oracle\u0026#39; registry_password: \u0026#39;Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35\u0026#39; push_registry_url: \u0026#39;docker.io/myorg\u0026#39; push_registry_auth: auths: docker.io/myorg: auth: \u0026#39;b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0\u0026#39; pull_registry_url: \u0026#39;docker.io/myorg\u0026#39; pull_registry_auth: auths: docker.io/myorg: auth: \u0026#39;b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0\u0026#39; ... Specify the URL/authentication credentials for your Container Repository in pull_registry_url, push_registry_url, registry_username and registry_password.\nFor the \u0026lt;pull|push\u0026gt;_registry_auth section, manually log into your repository and copy the values found in file created, often found in $HOME/.config/containers/auth.json\nYou maybe curious as to why there is duplication between the push and pull URL\u0026rsquo;s. The pull URL is used inside the pods while the push is used from the deployment machine. If you have a private registry inside the Kubernetes cluster, these URL\u0026rsquo;s could be different. This is the case for the Desktop installation; the push URL is localhost:5000, while the pull URL is \u0026lt;Registry Pod ClusterIP\u0026gt;:5000.\nConfiguration Management From the source package, run the configuration management Playbook:\nInstall Ansible Using python, install Ansible to run the Configuration Management Playbook. The helper scripts will create a Python Virtual Environment and install Ansible and additional modules:\n./setup_ansible.sh source ./activate.env Desktop Playbook If this is an Estate installation, the Infrastructure should be manually defined as per above. If this is a Desktop installation; run the helper Playbook to define the infrastructure:\nansible-Playbook desktop-apply.yaml Build and Push Images to the Container Repository For the Desktop installation, start a new terminal and tunnel or port-forward to the minikube cluster.

A class has certain properties, or fields. You create a class by just creating the first object in that class. You define the fields by just using them. Once a class has a field with a certain type, you cannot change that field type while objects using it exist.\nCreating an object The most basic operation you can do is to create a new object in the database. The examples on this page use the REST API to access the Parse Server. To create an object, you perform an HTTP POST to the Parse endpoint /parse/classes/ and append the name of the class of object you want to create, in this example the object is a GameScore. The content is provided in JSON format. You need to provide the correct APPLICATION_ID and update the endpoint address to match your environment:\ncurl -X POST \\ -H \u0026#34;X-Parse-Application-Id: COOLAPPV100\u0026#34; \\ -H \u0026#34;Content-Type: application/json\u0026#34; \\ -d \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;score\u0026#34;:100000,\u0026#34;playerName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;test user\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;cheatmode\u0026#34;:false}\u0026#39; \\ http://1.2.3.4/parse/classes/GameScore This command will create an entry for GameScore in the Schema collection and will create/update the GameScore collection with your new object.
