Check out Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices Developer Preview This release is a Developer Preview. This means that not all functionality is complete. In this release, approximately 80-90% of the Parse mobile APIs are working. For interested developers, approximately 2270 out of 2700 tests run successfully. This release is based on Parse Server version 5.2.7 and Parse Dashboard 5.0.0. Oracle is releasing this as a Developer Preview to allow interested developers to try it and provide feedback.\nThe following application program interface (API) families are mostly working:\nDatabase, including query Identity/Security File Caching GeoPoints Config Data The following API families are not expected to work in this release:\nCloud functions GraphQL Live query Push notifications The exposed Parse mobile API is exactly the same as an upstream Parse Server version 5.2.7. There are no changes to the public-facing API. All existing Parse Software Development Kits (SDKs) should work as-is with this Developer Preview for those APIs that are working.\nAbout the Oracle Database Storage Adapter for Parse This Developer Preview includes an Oracle Database storage adapter for Parse based on Parse Server version 5.2.7. The storage adapter is implemented using the Node.js node-oracledb library. Data is stored in the database in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) collections, using the Simple Oracle Document Access (SODA) API.\n","description":"Oracle Backend for Parse Platform - Developer Preview Oracle Backend for Parse Platform deploys mobile applications using Parse mobile APIs, and provisions an Oracle Backend as a Service (OBaaS) with Oracle Database and other infrastructure components that operate on multiple clouds.

An instance of Oracle Autonomous Database Serverless is created during installation of the Oracle Backend for Parse Platform.\nTo work with data in the database, you can use the Database Actions interface, which can be accessed from the OCI Console. The Oracle database is created in the same compartments as the Parse Server. In the OCI Console, navigate to Autonomous Database in the main menu and select the database with the application name that you configured during installation with the suffix DB.

For example:\nThis opens the Database Actions page where you have access to many database functions, including the ability to work with the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) collections where your Oracle Backend for Parse Platform data is stored.\nNOTE: If you are asked for credentials, you can obtain them by connecting to the Kubernetes cluster and extracting the password from the Parse Server log using the following command. You need to use the correct name of the Pod on your system, which is different than the name used in this example. In the following example, the user name is adam and the password is apple. You can use these credentials to log into Database Actions.\nuser@cloudshell:~ (us-ashburn-1)$ kubectl logs parse-server-646b97979-9pkq6 -n parse-server | grep databaseURI databaseURI: oracledb://adam:apple@MYMBAASAPPDB_TP Select the JSON tile to access the JSON Console.\nAt startup, the Parse Server creates a few collections including _Hooks, _SCHEMA and _User. The _SCHEMA collection is where the schema of other collections are defined. For example:\nTwo schema entries are created in this collection during the server boot, called _User and _Role as you can see in the preceding image.\nThe GameScore schema would have been created when you made the first POST request in the Working with Objects page.

The On-Premises installation includes both a Desktop installation and an Estate installation.\nThe Desktop installation can be used to explore a non-Production environment, while the Estate installation is targeted for a Production infrastructure.\nPrerequisites You must meet the following prerequisites to use the Oracle Backend for Parse Platform On-Premises. You need access to:\nAn Oracle Database Enterprise Edition 19.3.0.0 A Container Repository A Kubernetes cluster Python 3+ When installing on a Desktop, the previously mentioned prerequisites are met through an additional setup task, but there are additional desktop system or software requirements. For example:\n2 CPUs or more 8 GB of free memory 60 GB of free disk space (40 GB Minikube and container images, 20 GB database) Internet connection Minikube Podman1 Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) account to download the database image Download Download Oracle Backend for Parse Platform.\nSetup An On-Premises installation, whether Desktop or Estate, consists of defining the Parse application and infrastructure followed by running the Configuration Management Playbook to build images and deploy the Microservices.\nFor an Estate installation, you need a Kubernetes cluster and the kubectl command-line interface must be configured to communicate with the cluster.\nA Helper Playbook is provided for Desktop installations to assist in defining the infrastructure. Review the appropriate documentation for examples of installing and defining the Desktop installation.\nmacOS Ventura (x86) Oracle Linux 8 (x86) The Desktop Playbook is run as part of the Configuration Management Playbook.\nDownload the Database/Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) Images (Desktop Installation) The Desktop installation provisions an Oracle Database into the Kubernetes cluster. The images must be downloaded from the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry (Container Registry) before continuing.\nAfter installing Podman:\nLog in to the Container Registry:\npodman login container-registry.oracle.com\nPull the database image:\npodman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:19.3.0.0\nPull the ORDS image:\npodman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/ords:21.4.2-gh\nDefining the Parse Application (Estate Installation) The application is defined in ansible/vars/mbaas.yaml. For example:\n--- mbaas_edition: \u0026#34;COMMUNITY\u0026#34; app_name: \u0026#34;MYAPP\u0026#34; app_id: \u0026#34;PiITzsu3RCc499RRDOYOBgWnyAlMm6695r1536y1\u0026#34; master_key: \u0026#34;Q5CP7MHpoZhSwbk39XpHxamp4rJJ4F3vPZ3NZ7ee\u0026#34; dashboard_username: \u0026#34;ADMIN\u0026#34; dashboard_password: \u0026#34;OZ0-mSt-27Evb-Qy\u0026#34; storage: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; access_key: \u0026#34;N/A\u0026#34; private_key: \u0026#34;N/A\u0026#34; ... You can use any arbitrary string as your app_name, app_id, and master_key. These are used by your clients to authenticate with the Parse Server. It is recommended to specify a unique dashboard_username and dashboard_password.\nDefining the Database (Estate Installation) The database is defined in ansible/roles/database/vars/main.yaml. For example:\n--- database_oracle_dbs: [\u0026#34;BAASPDB\u0026#34;] database_default_db: BAASPDB BAASPDB: # noqa: var-naming[pattern] username: \u0026#34;PDBADMIN\u0026#34; password: \u0026#34;Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35\u0026#34; service: \u0026#34;(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=BAASPDB)))\u0026#34; ocid: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; ... The oracle_dbs and default_db keys should be the name of your Pluggable Database (PDB). These keys are followed by the PDB and keys defining how to access the PDB. If using Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication, specify the full path of the wallet file.\nDefining the Container Repository (Estate Installation) The Container Repository is defined in ansible/roles/registry/vars/main.yaml. For example:\n--- registry_username: \u0026#34;oracle\u0026#34; registry_password: \u0026#34;Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35\u0026#34; registry_push_url: \u0026#34;docker.io/myorg\u0026#34; registry_push_auth: auths: docker.io/myorg: auth: \u0026#34;b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0\u0026#34; registry_pull_url: \u0026#34;docker.io/myorg\u0026#34; registry_pull_auth: auths: docker.io/myorg: auth: \u0026#34;b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0\u0026#34; ... Specify the URL or authentication credentials for your Container Repository in registry_pull_url, registry_push_url, registry_username, and registry_password.\nFor the registry_pull_auth and registry_push_auth sections, manually log into your repository and copy the values found in created file, located in $HOME/.config/containers/auth.json\nWhy is there duplication between the push and pull URL\u0026rsquo;s? The push URL is used from the deployment machine while the pull URL is used inside the pods. If you have a private registry inside the Kubernetes cluster, these URL\u0026rsquo;s could be different. This is the case for the Desktop installation. The push URL is localhost:5000, while the pull URL is \u0026lt;Registry Pod ClusterIP\u0026gt;:5000.\nConfiguration Management From the source package, run the Configuration Management Playbook.\nInstall Ansible Using Python, install Ansible to run the Configuration Management Playbook. The Helper scripts create a Python virtual environment and installs Ansible and any additional modules. For example:\n./setup_ansible.sh source ./activate.env Desktop Playbook If this is an Estate installation, the infrastructure should be manually defined as previously mentioned. If this is a Desktop installation, run the Helper Playbook to define the infrastructure. For example:\nansible-Playbook desktop-apply.yaml Build and Push Images to the Container Repository For the Desktop installation, start a new terminal and tunnel or port-forward to the Minikube cluster. Refer to the specific platform details for more information.\nFor both installations, run the Images Playbook on the original terminal. For example:\nansible-playbook ansible/images_build.yaml Install the Microservices To install Microservices, process this command:\nansible-Playbook ansible/k8s_apply.yaml -t full Next, go to the macOS Ventura (x86) page to learn how to use the newly installed environment.\nFootnotes Certification has been performed against Podman.

It is a React Native application that allows you to walk around New York City (or simulate that in a device emulator) and it tells you about the closest attraction or point of interest.\nHere is what the Walking History application looks like running in the Android emulator:\nTry the Sample To try this sample application, you need the following:\nAn instance of Oracle Backend for Parse Platform deployed and running. Android Studio or Xcode, with the device emulator. For Android, use API level 30 and Android 11 for compatibilty with the version of React Native used in this sample. NodeJS to run the React Native Metro development server. Once you have the prerequisites, start cloning the source code for the application. For example:\ngit clone https://github.com/oracle/microservices-datadriven cd microservices-datadriven/developer-preview/walking-history This directory contains the source code for the application. In the source code, you need to update the file App.js to set the APPLICATION_ID and server URL to match your environment. Find these lines and update those two values. Note that the required values were provided in the output at the end of the log for the stack apply job during the installation. For example:\nconst App: () =\u0026gt; Node = () =\u0026gt; { const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === \u0026#39;dark\u0026#39;; const Parse = require(\u0026#39;parse/react-native.js\u0026#39;); Parse.setAsyncStorage(AsyncStorage); Parse.initialize(\u0026#34;APPLICATION_ID\u0026#34;); // \u0026lt;-- update this Parse.serverURL = \u0026#39;http://1.2.3.4/parse\u0026#39;; // \u0026lt;-- update this Once you have made the updates, you can start the Metro development server by running this command:\nnpx react-native start NOTE: The following instructions are for Android. If you are using the iPhone operating system (iOS), process the equivalent steps in Xcode.\nOpen the android sub-directory as a project in Android Studio. Create an emulator if you have not already done so (noting the specific version requirements previously mentioned) and then click Run (or choose Run... from the Run menu) to start the application on the emulator.\nClick on the three dots symbol in the emulator menu to open the Extended Controls. On the Location page, create a new route from 33 Peck Slip, New York to 14 W 34th Street, New York. Set the playback speed to 4x and click on Play Route. Your emulator now silumates walking around New York City for several minutes.\nAs you \u0026ldquo;walk\u0026rdquo; around, you see that the application updates your location and the nearest point of interest changes.\nExplore the Parse API Usage in the Source Code In addition to the Parse initialization in the App.js file, you can review the file components\\Location.js which uses the Parse Query API and the GeoPoints API to find a list of points of interest that are near the current location of the device (emulator). For example:\n// find the closest attraction and update the state console.log(\u0026#34;querying parse server for nearby attractions\u0026#34;); let query = new Parse.Query(\u0026#39;POI\u0026#39;); query.near(\u0026#39;location\u0026#39;, new Parse.GeoPoint(currentPosition.coords.latitude, currentPosition.coords.longitude)); let results = await query.find().catch(err =\u0026gt; console.log(\u0026#34;OOPS \u0026#34; + JSON.stringify(err))); Next, go to the Firebase API Emulation page to learn more.\n","description":"Walking History The Walking History sample application uses the Parse database and GeoPoints APIs.

Each object is an instance of a named class. A class has certain properties or fields. You create a class by creating the first object in that class. You define the fields by using them. Once a class has a field with a certain type, you cannot change that field type while objects using it exist.\nCreating an Object The most basic operation that you can do is to create a new object in the database. The following examples use the Representational State Transfer (REST) API to access the Parse Server. To create an object, perform an HTTP POST to the Parse endpoint /parse/classes/ and append the name of the class of the object that you want to create. In this example, the object is GameScore.

These are used by your clients to authenticate with the Parse Server. During creation of the Oracle Backend for Parse Platform environment, you provided an application ID as a configuration option. If any call to the Parse Server does not use a valid application ID, the call is rejected and returns this error message:\n{\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;unauthorized\u0026#34;} More information Learn more about working with objects in the Parse Server documentation.\nNext, go to the Using the Parse Dashboard page to learn how to use the dashboard.\n","description":"The Oracle Backend for Parse Platform stores your data in objects. Each object is an instance of a named class. A class has certain properties or fields. You create a class by creating the first object in that class. You define the fields by using them. Once a class has a field with a certain type, you cannot change that field type while objects using it exist.\nCreating an Object The most basic operation that you can do is to create a new object in the database."}]
