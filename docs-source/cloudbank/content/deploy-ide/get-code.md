Download a copy of the CloudBank sample application.

1. Clone the source repository

    Create a local clone of the CloudBank source repository using this command.

    ```shell
    <copy>git clone -b OBAAS-1.2.0 https://github.com/oracle/microservices-datadriven.git</copy>
    ```

    > **Note**: If you do not have **git** installed on your machine, you can download a zip file of the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/oracle/microservices-datadriven) and unzip it on your machine instead.

    The source code for the CloudBank application will be in the `microservices-datadriven` directory you just created, in the `cloudbank-v32` subdirectory.

    ```shell
    <copy>cd microservices-datadriven/cloudbank-v32</copy>
    ```
