This module walks you through building your very first microservice using Spring Boot. It assumes no prior knowledge of Spring Boot, so its a great place to start if you have not used Spring Boot before. This module demonstrates how to build a service with a *synchronous* API implemented as REST endpoints using Spring Web MVC, and how to store data in Oracle Database using Spring Data JPA.
