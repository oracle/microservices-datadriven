This module walks you through building your very first microservice using Spring Boot.
It assumes no prior knowledge of Spring Boot, so its a great place to start if you
have not used Spring Boot before. This module demonstrates how to build a service
with a *synchronous* API implemented as REST endpoints using Spring Web MVC, and how to
store data in Oracle Database using Spring Data JPA.
