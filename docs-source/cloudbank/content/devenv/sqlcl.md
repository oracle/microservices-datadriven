1. (Optional) Install SQLcl

   If you do not already have a database client, [Oracle SQL Developer Command Line (SQLcl)](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/sqlcl/) is a free command line interface for Oracle Database which includes great features like auto-completion and command history. All the Labs are using SQLcl as the database client.

   If you choose to use SQLcl make sure it is in your `PATH` variable:

      ```shell
      export PATH=/path/to/sqlcl:$PATH
      ```
