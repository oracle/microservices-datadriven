This modules introduces [Spring AI](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai) and explores how it can be used to build a CloudBank AI Assistant (chatbot) that will allow users to interact with CloudBank using a chat-based interface.

**Coming Soon:** We will be updating this module to help you learn about Retrieval Augmented Generation, Vector Database and AI Agents.
