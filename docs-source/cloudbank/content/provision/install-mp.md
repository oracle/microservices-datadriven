The Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI can be installed from OCI Marketplace.

> **Note:** You only need to choose one of the three deployment options - local, OCI Free Tier or OCI Marketplace.

This option installs a "production-sized" environment which includes an Oracle Compute Engine for Kubernetes ("OKE")
cluster and an Oracle Autonomous Database instance.  If you want to use a smaller, development/test-sized environment
that only requires a single OCI Compute Instance, please use the "Free Tier" option instead.

1. Access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace listing

    Open the [OCI Marketplace listing](https://cloudmarketplace.oracle.com/marketplace/en_US/listing/138899911), as shown in the image below:

    ![OCI Marketplace listing](../images/obaas-mp-listing.png " ")

    Click on the **Get App** button.

1. Log into your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account

    You will be taken to a Sign-In page. Choose they type of account you have and click on the **Sign In** button. If you did not create an account in the **Get Started** lab, you can do so now using the **Sign Up** button.

    ![Sign In page](../images/obaas-install-app.png " ")

    Sign in to your account as you normally do, using Single Sign-On or Direct Sign-In.

1. Choose the region and compartment

    In the next screen you can choose the region using the pull down in the top right hand corner, and then choose the compartment you want to install into.

    ![Install screen](../images/obaas-install-2.png " ")

    Review the terms and restrictions, and then click on the checkbox to accept them. Then, click on **Launch Stack**,

    > **Note:** This version of CloudBank is tested with **version 1.3.0**. Earlier versions may not contain all features used and you may see errors.

1. Review the **Create Stack** page

    Review the details on the **Create Stack** page. You may wish to update the **Name** or add tags. When you are ready, click on **Next**.

    ![Create stack screen](../images/obaas-create-stack.png " ")

1. In the **Backend as A Service** Section, fill in the following configuration variables as needed and select **Next**:

    * `Compartment` : Select the compartment where you want to install Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI.
    * `Application Name` (optional) : A random pet name that will be used as the application name if left empty.
    * `Edition` : Select *COMMUNITY* Edition. Standard edition will give more options for the installation but those are not required or used in this LiveLab.
    * `Existing Authorization Token` : Leave blank.

    ![Backend as A Service](../images/oci-stack-app-name.png " ")

1. In the **Load Balancers Options** section, leave the default values.

    * `Enable Public Load Balancer` : This option allows access to the load balancer from the internet (public IP). If not
      selected, access can only be from a private VCN.

1. Click **Next** to review your choices.

1. Complete the **Review** page

    Review the details on the **Review** page. Check the box next to **Run Apply**. When you are ready, click on **Create**.

    ![Review screen](../images/obaas-create-stack-3.png " ")

1. Review the apply screen

    The stack will now be applied. On the **Apply** screen (see below) you can monitor the progress of the installation in the **Logs** box. The installation should take about 30 minutes to complete. This includes the time needed to create your Oracle Autonomous Database instance, your Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes cluster and install the various components of the stack into the Kubernetes cluster.

    ![Stack apply screen](../images/obaas-apply.png " ")

    > **Note**: While you are waiting for the installation to complete is a great time to start setting up your development environment (see the next lab). You can come back here where you are done to check the installation completed successfully.

### Verify the installation

1. Check the logs for errors

    Scroll down to the bottom of the log to see the outcome. If there was an error during installation, details will be included at the end of the log. The most common errors are due to insufficient quota for some resource. If you get an error about insufficient quota, you may need to clean up unused resources or request a quota increase for the affected resource. Once you have done that, navigate back to the stack details (for example, using the breadcrumbs) and click on the **Apply** to try again.

    When the installation completes normally, the end of the log should look something like this:

    ```text
    Apply complete! Resources: 77 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:
    adb_ip = "Secured Access"
    adb_name = "KATYDIDDB"
    apisix_admin_password = <sensitive>
    grafana_admin_password = <sensitive>
    kubeconfig_cmd = "oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig --cluster-id ocid1.cluster.oc1... --region us-ashburn-1 --token-version 2.0.0 --kube-endpoint PUBLIC_ENDPOINT --file $HOME/.kube/config"
    oractl_admin_password = <sensitive>
    oractl_user_password = <sensitive>
    ```

    To get the sensitive information you need to click on the **Application Information** tab, and click on *unlock* or *show* to display the values:

    ![Output screen](../images/obaas-outputs.png " ")

    > **Note**: Keep a copy of the values, you will need these in later labs.

1. Verify you can access the Kubernetes cluster

    In later labs, you will look at various resources in Kubernetes. You will need a Kubernetes configuration file to access the cluster. For now, accessing the cluster from OCI Cloud Shell will be sufficient to verify the installation.

    Open the OCI Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon next to the region in the top right corner of the console and then clicking on **Cloud Shell**.

    ![Open OCI CLoud Shell](../images/obaas-cloud-shell.png " ")

    Run the command provided at the end of your installation log or the information from the **Application Information** tab,to obtain the Kubernetes configuration file.  The command will be similar to this:

    ```shell
    oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig --cluster-id ocid1.cluster.oc1.i..... --region us-ashburn-1 --token-version 2.0.0 --kube-endpoint PUBLIC_ENDPOINT --file $HOME/.kube/config
    ```

    Check that you can access the cluster using this command:

    ```shell
    $ kubectl get pods -n obaas-admin
    NAME                                READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
    graalvm-compiler-79988b886c-hgw68   1/1     Running            0          10m
    obaas-admin-66599b65-vb662          1/1     Running            0          10m
    soc-ui-5dbd6f9cb4-kjdj8             0/1     Running            0          10m
    ```

    Your output will be slightly different, but you should see one pod listed in the output.  This is enough to confirm that you have correctly configured access to the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Verify you can connect to the APISIX API Gateway

    You will need to provide the correct IP address for the API Gateway in your backend environment.  You can find the IP address using this command, you need the one listed in the `EXTERNAL-IP` column:

    ```shell
    $ kubectl -n ingress-nginx get service ingress-nginx-controller
    NAME                       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
    ingress-nginx-controller   LoadBalancer   10.123.10.127   EXTERNAL-IP   80:30389/TCP,443:30458/TCP   13d
    ```

    Now use this command (with your IP address in the column **EXTERNAL-IP**) to make a request to the API Gateway.  You should receive a response with an HTTP Status Code 404 (Not Found) and an error message in JSON format as shown below.  Don't worry about the 404, you will deploy some services soon, but this test is enough to know the API Gateway started up successfully:

    ```shell
    $ curl -i http://<EXTERNAL-IP>>
    HTTP/1.1 404
    Date: Wed, 01 Mar 2023 19:21:08 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Connection: keep-alive
    Vary: Origin
    Vary: Access-Control-Request-Method
    Vary: Access-Control-Request-Headers
    
    {"timestamp":"2023-03-01T19:21:08.031+00:00","status":404,"error":"Not Found","path":"/"}
    ```
