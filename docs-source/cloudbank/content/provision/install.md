1. Review the apply screen

    The stack will now be applied. On the **Apply** screen (see below) you can monitor the progress of the installation in the **Logs** box. The installation should take about 30 minutes to complete. This includes the time needed to create your Oracle Autonomous Database instance, your Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes cluster and install the various components of the stack into the Kubernetes cluster.

    > **Note**: While you are waiting for the installation to complete is a great time to start setting up your development environment (see the next lab). You can come back here where you are done to check the installation completed successfully.
