### About Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices

Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices allows developers to build microservices in Spring Boot and provision a backend as a service with the Oracle Database and other infrastructure components that operate on multiple clouds. This service vastly simplifies the task of building, testing, and operating microservices platforms for reliable, secure, and scalable enterprise applications.
