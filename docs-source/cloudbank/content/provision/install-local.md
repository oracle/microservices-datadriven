This option allows you to run Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI in a containerized environment on your local machine.  This option is recommended if you do have enough free capacity on your local machine to run the environment, a minimum of 64GB RAM and 80GB free disk are recommended. This option provides an environment with adequate resources for development and testing, but is not suitable for a production-sized deployment or performance testing.

   > **Note:** You only need to choose one of the three deployment options - local, OCI Free Tier or OCI Marketplace.

1. Prerequisites

   The following prerequisites are required to run the local environment:

   * A container runtime environment such as Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop or Podman Desktop.
   * The ability to run a BASH script, or to read one and run equivalent commands in your environment.
   * 64GB RAM and 80GB free disk space.

1. Download the required files

   * If you have not already done so, clone the Microservices Data-Driven GitHub repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/oracle/microservices-datadriven
     ```

   * Change into the directory with the local environment files:

     ```bash
     cd microservices-datadriven/cloudbank-v4/local-environment
     ```

1. Start the environment

   * Run the provided script to start the environment, including a Kubernetes cluster in a container (using k3s), Oracle Backend
     for Spring Boot and Microservices and an Oracle Database instance inside that cluster.

     ```bash
     ./obaas.sh
     ```  

   * It will take approximately six to ten minutes (depending on the size of your machine) for all of the containers
     to reach ready/running state. You can watch the progress using this command:

     ```bash
     watch KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/k3s_data/kubeconfig/kubeconfig.yaml kubectl get pod -A
     ```

     > **Note:** You will need to provide the `KUBECONFIG` variable as shown, or export it in your shell, each time you wish to run a `kubectl` command to access the cluster.

     When the environment is fully started, the output will appear similar to this:

     ![Completed startup](../images/install-free-tier-2.png " ")

1. Verify access to web user interfaces

   * On your local machine, open a browser and navigate to the [Spring Operations Center](https://localhost:433/soc).

   * Log in using the pre-defined user `obaas-admin` and password `Welcome-12345`.

    > **Note:** Since this is a development environment with no DNS name, it is configured with self-signed certificates. Your browser will warn you about the connection security.

   * If you are using Chrome, click on the **Advanced** link and then the **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)** link.
     If you are using a different browser, perform the equivalent actions.

   * The Spring Operations Center main dashboard will appear similar to this:

     ![Spring Operations Center](../images/install-free-tier-5.png " ")
