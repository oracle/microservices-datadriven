* Add a description or tags if desired
* Click on the "Next" button

On the "Configure variables" page, in the "Backend as a Service" section (see image below):

* Set an application name if desired, if you do not, a randomized value will be generated.  This will be the name of the Parse application
* Set an application ID if desired, if you do not, a randomized value will be generated.  This will be the Parse APPLICATION_ID
* Set a server master key if desired, if you do not, a randomized value will be generated.  This will the Parse MASTER_KEY

In the "Control Plane Options" section, modify the CIDR if desired.  Note that you will only be able to access the service from IP
addresses in the specified CIDR.

In the "Node Pool" section you can customize the number of nodes and enable auto-scaling if desired.

In the "Load Balancers Options" section you can customize the load balancer shape and the CIDR for client access.  For simple testing, Oracle
recommends using the provided default values.

In the "Database Options" section you can customize the database shape and the CIDR for client access. Note that you will not be able to access
Datbase Actions if you change the network access to "PRIVATE_ENDPOINT_ACCESS"

Once you have completed customization, click on the "Next" button. 

The "Review" page is displayed, check your settings and then click on the "Create" button to create the "stack" and run the Terraform apply
action to create all of the associated resources.  

You can monitor the installation in the log. Installation takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.  Most of this time is spent provisioning
the Kubernetes cluster, its nodes, and the database.

When the installation is finished, some important information will be included at the end of the log.  You will need this information to access
the newly created environment:

```
application_id = "COOLAPPV100"
dashboard_password = <sensitive>
dashboard_uri = "http://1.2.3.4"
dashboard_user = "ADMIN"
kubeconfig_cmd = "oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig --cluster-id ocid1.cluster.oc1.iad.xxx
 --file $HOME/.kube/config --region us-ashburn-1 --token-version 2.0.0 --kube-endpoint PUBLIC_ENDPOINT"
parse_endpoint = "1.2.3.4/parse"
```

Next, move on the the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) page to learn how to use the newly installed environment.
