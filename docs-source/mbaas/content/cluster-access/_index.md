title: "Kubernetes Access"
---

As an Oracle Backend for Parse Platform user, it is expected that you probably won't need to access the underlying infrastructure.  However, if you do want to have a look
around, here is how you can access the Kubernetes cluster where your Oracle Backend for Parse Platform is running.

The Oracle Backend for Parse Platform setup created a Kubernetes cluster where the server and dashboard components are deployment.  At the end of setup, you were provided
with a command to creating a Kubernetes configuration file to access that cluster.

```
kubeconfig_cmd = "oci ce cluster create-kubeconfig --cluster-id ocid1.cluster.oc1.iad.xxx
 --file $HOME/.kube/config --region us-ashburn-1 --token-version 2.0.0 --kube-endpoint PUBLIC_ENDPOINT"
 ```

To use `kubectl` on your local machine, you will need to have the [OCI CLI installed and configured](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cliconcepts.htm).

**Note:** The generated `kubeconfig` file will only work if you are using the `DEFAULT` profile in your OCI CLI configuration file. If you are using a different OCI CLI profile you must add `--profile <NAME>` to the command by editing the generated Kubernetes config file and add the following lines:

```
- --profile
- MAACLOUD
```

For example:

```
- name: user-xxxx
  user:
    exec:
      apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
      args:
      - ce
      - cluster
      - generate-token
      - --cluster-id
      - ocid1.cluster....xxxx
      - --region
      - us-ashburn-1
      - --profile
      - YOUR_PROFILE_NAME
      command: oci
```

## Using OCI Cloud Shell

A simple alternative is to use the [OCI Cloud Shell](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm), which is provided in
the OCI Console.  You can open Cloud Shell by clicking Developer Tools in
the upper right hand corner of the OCI Console.

Run the provided command to create your Kubernetes configuration file and then you will be able to access the Kubernetes
cluster.  For example, you can list the pods in your cluster:

```
Welcome to Oracle Cloud Shell.
 
Update: Cloud Shell will now use Oracle JDK 11 by default. To change this, see Managing Language Runtimes in the Cloud Shell documentation.
 
Your Cloud Shell machine comes with 5GB of storage for your home directory. Your Cloud Shell (machine and home directory) are located in: US East (Ashburn).
You are using Cloud Shell in tenancy xxxx as an OCI user xxxx

The Oracle Backend for Parse Platform Parse Server is running in the `parse-server` namespace and Parse Dashboard is running in the `parse-dashboard` namespace.
