The Oracle Backend for Parse Platform installation includes a dashboard endpoint.  The Parse Dashboard is a web user interface for managing your Parse applications.

The dashboard URL was provided to you at the end of set up, and you chose the administrative user name and password during install.

To log in to the dashboard, go to the provided URL and log in with the `Admin` credentials. For example:

![Dashboard Login Page](../dashboard-login-page.png)

After you log in, you see the **Landing Page** that lists your applications. Most likely, you will have just one application that you created during
configuration of the Oracle Backend for Parse Platform.  You can click on the application to see details and to manage it. For example:

![Dashboard Landing Page](../dashboard-landing-page.png)

Note the collections listed in the left hand panel. Click `GameScore` to see the data that you created earlier. For example:

![Dashboard GameScore page](../dashboard-gamescore.png)
