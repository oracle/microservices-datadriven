# Firebase API Emulation

The _Developer_ _Preview_ includes an example of Firebase API emulation.

The Firebase API emulation is implemented in a library called `parsef`. This library is *alpha quality* and provided
only as a proof-of-concept for developers to experiment with.

To try the example, explore the following pages: 

* [Friendly Eats Tutorial](../firebase-emulation/friendly-eats)
* [Extra Parse Test Code](../firebase-emulation/extra)

More detailed information about what APIs are implemented in this example is available on this page: 

* [Implemented APIs](../firebase-emulation/scope)
