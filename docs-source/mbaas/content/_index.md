Oracle MBaaS (Mobile Backend as a Service) allows developers to build and deploy mobile applications using Parse mobile APIs, and provision a backend as a service with the Oracle Database and other infrastructure components that operate on multiple clouds. This service vastly simplifies the task of building, testing, and operating a mobile app dev platform for reliable, secure, and scalable enterprise applications. This version includes an Oracle Database adapter to Parse Platform (Parse already has MongoDB and Postgres adapters), and a quick demo of Google Firebase APIs emulated using Parse APIs.

The following software components are deployed in an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) for customer usage with Oracle MBaaS

* Oracle Autonomus Databasee Shared (not deployed in OKE)
* Parse Server
* Parse Dashboard
