title: "Working with Objects"
---

The Oracle Backend for Parse Platform stores your data in objects. Each object is an instance of a named class. A class has certain properties or fields. You
create a class by creating the first object in that class. You define the fields by using them. Once a class has a field with a certain type, you
cannot change that field type while objects using it exist.

## Creating an Object

The most basic operation you can do is to create a new object in the database. The following examples use the Representational State Transfer (REST) API to access
the Parse Server. To create
an object, perform an HTTP POST to the Parse endpoint `/parse/classes/` and append the name of the class of the object that you want to create. In this example, the
object is `GameScore`.  The content is provided in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Provide the correct `APPLICATION_ID` and update the endpoint address to match
your environment. For example:

```
curl -X POST \
     -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: COOLAPPV100" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"score":100000,"playerName":"test user","cheatmode":false}' \
     http://1.2.3.4/parse/classes/GameScore
```

This command creates an entry for `GameScore` in the schema collection and creates or updates the `GameScore` collection with your new object. It returns
the `objectId` for the newly created object. For example:

```
{"objectId":"Ts9B8JSBBX","createdAt":"2022-12-12T14:47:28.431Z"}
```

The `objectId` is the unique identifier for a document in the collection.  

## Retrieving an Object 

To retrieve the newly created object, use the HTTP GET API as shown in the following example.  Append the `objectId` to the end of the URL. Update the command
with your `APPLICATION_ID` and endpoint address. For example:

```
curl -X GET \
     -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: COOLAPPV100" \
     http://1.2.3.4/parse/classes/GameScore/Ts9B8JSBBX
# output (formatted):
{
    "score":100000,
    "playerName":"test user",
    "cheatmode":false,
    "updatedAt":"2022-12-12T14:47:28.431Z",
    "createdAt":"2022-12-12T14:47:28.431Z",
    "objectId":"Ts9B8JSBBX"
}
```

**NOTE:** You can use any arbitrary string as your `APPLICATION_ID`. These are used by your clients to authenticate with the Parse Server. During creation of
the Oracle Backend for Parse Platform environment, you provided an application ID as a configuration option. If any call to the Parse Server does not use a
valid application ID, the call is rejected with this error message:

```
{"error":"unauthorized"}
```
