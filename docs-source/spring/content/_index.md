Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI allows developers to build microservices in Helidon and/or Spring Boot and provisions a "backend as a service" with Oracle Database and other infrastructure components that operate on multiple clouds. Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI vastly simplifies the task of building, testing, and operating microservices platforms for reliable, secure, and scalable enterprise applications.

{{< hint type=[warning] icon=gdoc_fire title="Version 1.4.0 (production) released July 2025" >}}
 Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI Version 1.4.0 is now generally available and suitable for production use. This version supports and recommends Helidon 4.1.1, Spring Boot 3.3.x, 3.2.x, Spring 6.1 and Spring Cloud 2023.0.x, with limited backwards compatibility for Spring Boot 2.7.x.

If you are building Spring Boot applications with Oracle Database, you should also check out [Spring Cloud Oracle](https://github.com/oracle/spring-cloud-oracle) which is the home of a number of the components used in Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI, and which you can also use in your own applications!

## Try it out with CloudBank AI

To learn more about deploying and using Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI, we recommend our
[CloudBank AI](https://bit.ly/cloudbankAI) self-paced, on-demand hands-on lab.

In the [CloudBank AI](https://bit.ly/cloudbankAI) hands-on lab, you can learn how to:

- Install Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI.
- Set up a development environment for Helidon and/or Spring Boot.
- Build Spring Boot microservices from scratch using Spring Web to create
  Representational State Transfer (REST) services.
- Use service discovery and client-side load balancing.
- Use Spring Actuator to allow monitoring of services.
- Create services that use asynchronous messaging with Java Message Service (JMS) instead of REST.
- Implement the Saga pattern to manage data consistency across microservices.
- Use the APISIX API Gateway to expose services to clients.
- Build a conversational chatbot using Spring AI and self-host LLMs with Ollama.
