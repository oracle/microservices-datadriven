Oracle Backend for Spring Boot allows developers to build Microservices in Spring Boot and provisions a backend as a service with
Oracle Database and other infrastructure components that operate on multiple clouds. This service vastly simplifies the task of
building, testing, and operating Microservices platforms for reliable, secure, and scalable enterprise applications.
