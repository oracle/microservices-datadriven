Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices allows developers to build microservices in Spring Boot and provisions a "backend as a service" with
Oracle Database and other infrastructure components that operate on multiple clouds. Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices vastly simplifies the task of
building, testing, and operating microservices platforms for reliable, secure, and scalable enterprise applications.

In the [CloudBank](https://bit.ly/CloudBankOnOBaaS) hands-on lab, you can learn how to:

- Install Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices.
- Set up a development environment for Spring Boot.
- Build Spring Boot microservices from scratch using Spring Web to create
  Representational State Transfer (REST) services.
- Use service discovery and client-side load balancing.
- Use Spring Actuator to allow monitoring of services.
- Create services that use asynchronous messaging with Java Message Service (JMS) instead of REST.
- Implement the Saga pattern to manage data consistency across microservices.
- Use the APISIX API Gateway to expose services to clients.
- Extend a provided Flutter client to add a new "cloud cash" feature that uses the services you have built.
