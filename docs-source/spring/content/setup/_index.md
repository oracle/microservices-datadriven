You must meet the following prerequisites to use Oracle Backend as a Service for Spring Cloud:

- An OCI account in a tenancy with sufficient quota to create:
    - An OCI Container Engine for Kubernetes cluster, plus a node pool with three worker nodes
    - A VCN with at least two public IP's available
    - A public load balancer

## Setup the environment

1. Go to the [OCI Marketplace listing for Oracle Backend as a Service for Spring Cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com/marketplace/application/138899911).

    
    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    ![OCI Marketplace listing](../ebaas-mp-listing.png)
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

    Choose the target compartment, agree to the terms and click on the "Launch Stack" button.  This will start the wizard
    to create the new stack. On the first page choose a compartment to host your stack and select `Next`

    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    ![OCI Stack wizard page 1](../ebaas-stack-page1.png)
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

    Fill in the following configuration variables as needed and select `Next`

    * `Application Name` (Optional)
    * OKE Control Plane Options.
        * `Public Control Plane`: this option allows access the OKE Control Plane from the Internet (Public IP). If not selected, access
          will only be from a private VCN.
        * `Control Plane Access Control`: CIDR (IP range) allowed to access the control plane (Oracle recommends you set this as restrictive as possible).
        * `Enable Horizontal Pod Scaling?`: The [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengusinghorizontalpodautoscaler.htm#Using_Kubernetes_Horizontal_Pod_Autoscaler) can help applications scale out to meet increased demand, or scale in when resources are no longer needed.
        * `Node Pool Workers`: Number of Kubernetes worker nodes (virutal machines) to attach to the OKE Cluster.

    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

    Now you can review the stack configuration and save the changes.  Oracle recommends that you do not check the "Run apply" option - this will
    give you the opportunity to run the "plan" first and check for issues.

    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

3. Apply the Stack 

    After you create your stack, you will be able to test the plan, edit the stack, and apply or destroy the stack.

    Oracle recommends you test the plan before applying the stack, in order to identify any issues before you start
    creating resources.   Testing a plan does not create any actual resources, it is just a "dry run" to tell you
    what would happen if you applied.
    
    You can test the plan by clicking on the "Plan" button and then reviewing the output.  If you see any
    issues, for example you may find that you do not have enough quota for some resource, you can fix that issue before
    proceeding. 

    When you are happy with the results of the test, you can apply the stack by clicking on the "Apply" button. This will create your Oracle Backend
    as a Service for Spring Cloud Environment.  This takes about 20 minutes to complete.  A lot of this time is spent provisioning the
    Kuberentes cluster, worker nodes, and database.  You can watch the logs to follow progress of the operation.

    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    {{< img name="oci-stack-apply" size="large" lazy=false >}}
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

    The OCI Resource Manager will apply your stack and generate the execution logs.
