## Overview of the Setup Process

This video provides a quick overview of the setup process.

{{< youtube rAi10TiUraE >}}

Installing Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservice takes approximately one hour to complete. The following steps are involved:

- [Setup the OCI environment](#set-up-the-oci-environment)
- [Setup of the Local Environment](#set-up-the-local-machine)
- [Access environment variables from the OCI Console](#access-information-and-passwords-from-the-oci-console)

## Set Up the OCI Environment

To set up the OCI environment, process these steps:

1. Go to the [OCI Marketplace listing for Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices](https://cloud.oracle.com/marketplace/application/138899911).

    {{< img name="ebaas-stack-page1" size="large" lazy=false >}}
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

1. In the **Backend as A Service** Section, fill in the following configuration variables as needed and select **Next**:

    - `Compartment` : Select the compartment where you want to install Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices.
    - `Application Name` (optional) : A random pet name that will be used as the application name if left empty.
    - `Edition` : Select between *COMMUNITY* and *STANDARD* Edition.
        - *COMMUNITY* - for developers for quick start to testing Spring Boot Microservices with an integrated backend. Teams can start with the deployment and scale up as processing demand grows. Community support only.
        - *STANDARD* - focused for pre-prod and production environments with an emphasis on deployment, scaling, and high availability. Oracle support is included with a Oracle Database support agreement. All features for developers are the same so start here if youâ€™re porting an existing Spring Boot application stack and expect to get into production soon.  This edition allows for additional Bring Your Own (BYO) capabilities.
    - `Existing Authorization Token` (optional) - Enter an existing Authorization token. The token is used by the cluster to pull images from the Oracle Container Registry. If left empty the token will be created.

      **WARNING:** Deletion or expiration of the token will result in the failure to pull images later.  Also you must have one free OCI auth token (note that the maximum is two per user). You can *NOT* use someone elses token.

   {{< hint type=[warning] icon=gdoc_check title=Warning >}}
   **Never** run a **Development** mode HashiCorp Vault Server in a production environment. It is insecure and will lose data on every restart (since it stores data in-memory). It is only intended for development or experimentation.
   {{< /hint >}}

1. (*Standard Edition Only*) If you check the checkbox *Enable Container Registry Vulnerability Scanning* in the section **Additional Options** you will enable the automatic Vulnerability Scanning on images stored in the Oracle Container Registry.

      <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
      {{< img name="oci-stack-additional-options" size="large" lazy=false >}}
      <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

1. Now you can review the stack configuration and save the changes. Oracle recommends that you do not check the **Run apply** option. This gives you the opportunity to run the "plan" first and check for issues. Click **Create**

   <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
   {{< img name="oci-private-template-create-stack-config-review" size="large" lazy=false >}}
   <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

1. Apply the stack.

   After you create the stack, you can test the plan, edit the stack, and apply or destroy the stack.

   Oracle recommends that you test the plan before applying the stack in order to identify any issues before you start
   creating resources. Testing a plan does not create any actual resources. It is just an exercise to tell you what would
   happen if you did apply the stack.

   You can test the plan by clicking on **Plan** and reviewing the output. You can fix any issues (for example, you may find that you do not have enough quota for some resources) before proceeding.

   <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
   {{< img name="oci-stack-plan" size="large" lazy=false >}}
   <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

1. When you are happy with the results of the test, you can apply the stack by clicking on **Apply**. This creates your Oracle Backend as a Service and Microservices for a Spring Cloud environment. This takes about 20 minutes to complete. Much of this time is spent provisioning the Kubernetes cluster, worker nodes, database and all the included services. You can watch the logs to follow the progress of the operation.

    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    {{< img name="oci-stack-apply" size="large" lazy=false >}}
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

1. The OCI Resource Manager applies your stack and generates the execution logs. The apply job takes approximately 45 minutes.

    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    {{< img name="oci-stack-apply-logs" size="large" lazy=false >}}
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

1. When the **Apply** job finishes you can collect the OKE access information by clicking on **Outputs**.

    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    {{< img name="oci-stack-outputs" size="large" lazy=false >}}
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

1. Click on **Copy** for the variable named `kubeconfig_cmd`. Save this information because it is needed to access the OKE cluster.

    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    {{< img name="oci-stack-output-oke" size="large" lazy=false >}}
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

## Set Up the Local Machine

To set up the local machine, process these steps:

1. Set up cluster access.

   To access a cluster, use the `kubectl` command-line interface that is installed (see the [Kubernetes access](../cluster-access)) locally.
   If you have not already done so, do the following:

1. Install the `kubectl` command-line interface (see the [kubectl documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)).

1. Generate an API signing key pair. If you already have an API signing key pair, go to the next step. If not:

   a. Use OpenSSL commands to generate the key pair in the required P-Early-Media (PEM) format. If you are using Windows, you need to install Git Bash for Windows in order to run the commands. See [How to Generate an API Signing Key](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#two).

   b. Copy the contents of the public key to the clipboard to paste the value into the Console later.

1. Add the public key value of the API signing key pair to the **User Settings** for your user name. For example:

   a. In the upper right corner of the OCI Console, open the **Profile** menu (User menu symbol) and click **User Settings** to view the details.

   b. Click **Add Public Key**.

   c. Paste the value of the public key into the window and click **Add**.

      The key is uploaded and its fingerprint is displayed (for example, d1:b2:32:53:d3:5f:cf:68:2d:6f:8b:5f:77:8f:07:13).

1. Install and configure the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI. For example:

   a. Install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI version 2.6.4 (or later). See [Quickstart](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm#Quickstart).

   b. Configure the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI. See [Configuring the CLI](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliconfigure.htm#Configuring_the_CLI).

1. Install the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices command-line.

   The Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices command-line interface, `oractl`, is available for Linux and Mac systems. Download the binary that you want from the [Releases](https://github.com/oracle/microservices-datadriven/releases/tag/OBAAS-1.1.3) page and add it to your PATH environment variable. You can rename the binary to remove the suffix.

   If your environment is a Linux or Mac machine, run `chmod +x` on the downloaded binary. Also, if your environment is a Mac, run the following command. Otherwise, you get a security warning and the CLI does not work:

   `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine <downloaded-file>`
