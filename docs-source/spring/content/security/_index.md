The Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices has the following security characteristics:

- All access to the database is done using the Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) database wallet. The user name, password, and URL are stored in Kubernetes secrets.

- Accessing the dashboards can only be done using port-forwarding. The passwords for the dashboards are provied by the installer or autogenerated and stored in Kubernetes secrets.

- The only "public" exposure is the Apache APISIX Gateway (note that the dashboard is not exposed publicly).

- Services deployed to the platform are not exposed through the Apache APISIX Gateway automatically.  If you want to expose the service through the gateway, you must define a route in the Apache APISIX dashboard. [APISIX Gateway Documentation](../platform/apigw)

- The deployed platform services are using using self-signed certificates.

- A customer application can only access services running in the platform using the Apache APISIX Gateway. [APISIX Gateway Documentation](../platform/apigw)

- The customer application can be secured using Spring Security (for example, Spring OAuth 2.0 Resource Server). An external authorization server is recommended (for example Okta or Auth0).

- Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices provides an authorization server which is an engine to authenticate and authorize requests to various components in Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices. The end user can manage users using REST Endpoints. [AuthZ Server Documentation](../security/azn-server)

- Oracle Backend for Spring Boot and Microservices contains HashiCorp Vault to secure, store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets, and other sensitive data. [HashiCorp Vault Documentation](../platform/vault)
