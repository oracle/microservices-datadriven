## CloudBank - Building an App with Spring Boot and Mobile APIs with Oracle Database and Kubernetes

[In this workshop (~ 2 hours)](https://bit.ly/CloudBankOnOBaaS) you learn how to build microservices using Spring Boot and deploy them to the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot. You learn about accessing the database using Java Persistence API (JPA), service discovery, exposing services with the API Gateway, managing transactions across microservices, workflow, and using observability tools to monitor your services and diagnose issues. You also learn about building a web and mobile user interface for your services using Flutter and Parse Platform.

If you have already deployed Oracle Backend for Spring Boot, you can skip Lab 1 (Provision an instance).
