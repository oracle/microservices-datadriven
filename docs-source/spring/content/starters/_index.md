## Spring Cloud Oracle

Spring Cloud Oracle provides a number of Spring Boot Starters that make it easy to use various Oracle technologies in Spring Boot projects.

The Spring Cloud Oracle Starters are available in [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/com.oracle.cloud.spring).

**Note**: The versioning of starters was originally in line with the matching Spring Boot version, but starting in November 2023, the version numbering scheme was changed to more closely align with Oracle Database version numbering.  The 23.4.0 starter is supported for Spring Boot 3.0 and later (including 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4).  For Spring Boot 2.7.x users, use the matching 2.7.x version of the starter.
