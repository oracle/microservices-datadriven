# On-Premises Installation

The Oracle Backend for Spring Boot is available to install On-Premises.  The On-Premises installation includes both a _Desktop_ installation and an _Estate_ installation.

The _Desktop_ installation can be used to explore in a non-production environment, while the _Estate_ installation is targeted for the production infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

You must meet the following prerequisites to use the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot On-Premises. You need:

* Access to an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition 21.3.0.0
* Access to a container repository
* Access to a Kubernetes cluster
* [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/)

When installing on a _Desktop_, the previously mentioned pre-requisites are met through an additional Setup task, but there are additional desktop system or software requirements. For example:

* 2 CPUs or more
* 8 GB of free memory
* 60 GB of free disk space (40 GB minikube and container images, 20 GB database)
* Internet connection
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
* [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/)[^1]
* Oracle Single Sign-On (SSO) account to download the database image

## Download

Download [Oracle Backend for Spring Boot](https://github.com/oracle/microservices-datadriven/releases/download/OBAAS-1.0.0/onprem-ebaas_latest.zip).

## Setup

An On-Premises installation, whether _Desktop_ or _Estate_, consists of defining the infrastructure followed by running the Configuration Management playbook to build images and deploy the microservices.

For an _Estate_ installation, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.

A helper Playbook has been provided for the _Desktop_ installations to assist in defining the infrastructure.  Review the appropriate documentation for examples of installing and defining the _Desktop_ installation. For example:

* [MacOS Ventura (x86)](macos_ventura/_index.md)
* [Oracle Linux 8 (x86)](ol8/_index.md)

The _Desktop_ playbook is run as part of the Configuration Management playbook.

## Download the Database or ORDS Images (_Desktop_  Installation)

The _Desktop_ installation provisions an Oracle Database to the Kubernetes cluster.  The images must be downloaded from [Oracle's Container Registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/) before continuing.

After installing Podman, process these steps:

1. Log into Oracle's Container Registry. For example: 

   `podman login container-registry.oracle.com`
   
2. Pull the database image. For example: 

   `podman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:21.3.0.0`
   
3. Pull the Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) image. For example: 

   `podman pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/ords:21.4.2-gh`


### Defining the Database  (_Estate_  Installation)

The database is defined in `ansible/roles/database/vars/main.yaml`. For example:  

```yaml
---
oracle_dbs: ['BAASPDB']
default_db: BAASPDB
BAASPDB:
  username: 'PDBADMIN'
  password: 'Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35'
  service: '(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=BAASPDB)))'
  ocid: ''
...
```

The `oracle_dbs` and `default_db` key values should be the name of your Pluggable Database (PDB).  These are followed by the PDB name and Key/Values defining how to access the PDB.  If using mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) authentication, specify the full path of the wallet file.

### Defining the Container Repository  (_Estate_  Installation)

The container repository is defined in `ansible/roles/registry/vars/main.yaml`.  For example:

```yaml
---
registry_username: 'oracle'
registry_password: 'Correct-horse-Battery-staple-35'
push_registry_url: 'docker.io/myorg'
push_registry_auth:
  auths:
    docker.io/myorg:
      auth: 'b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0'
pull_registry_url: 'docker.io/myorg'
pull_registry_auth:
  auths:
    docker.io/myorg:
      auth: 'b3JhY2xlOjdaUVgxLXhhbFR0NTJsS0VITlA0'
...
```

Specify the URL or authentication credentials for your Container Repository in `pull_registry_url`, `push_registry_url`, `registry_username` and `registry_password`.  

For the `registry_auth` section, manually log into your repository and copy the values found in the previously created file, often found in `$HOME/.config/containers/auth.json`

There may be duplication between the push and pull URL's.  The pull URL is used inside the pods while the push is used from the deployment machine.  If you have a private registry inside the Kubernetes cluster, these URL's could be different.  This is the case for the _Desktop_ installation; the push URL is `localhost:5000`, while the pull URL is `<Registry Pod ClusterIP>:5000`.

## Configuration Management

From the source package, run the Configuration Management playbook.

### Install Ansible

Using Python, install Ansible to run the Configuration Management playbook.  The helper script creates a Python virtual environment and installs Ansible along with other additional modules. For example:

```bash
./setup_ansible.sh
source ./activate.env
```

### Desktop Playbook

If this is an _Estate_ installation, the infrastructure should be manually defined as previously stated.  

If this is a _Desktop_ installation, run the helper Playbook to define the infrastructure. For example:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/desktop-apply.yaml
```

### Build and Push Images to the Container Repository

For the _Desktop_ installation, start a new terminal and tunnel or port-forward to the minikube cluster.  Refer to the specific platform details for more information.

For both installations, run the Images Playbook on the original terminal. For example:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/images_build.yaml
```

### Install the Microservices

Install the microservices by running this command:

```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/k8s_apply.yaml -t full
```

## Finish

Next, go to the [Getting Started](../getting-started/) page to learn how to use the newly installed environment.

## Footnotes

[^1]: Certification has been performed against Podman. However, other container or virtual machine managers are available and may be substituted.  Experience is needed and your milage may vary.
