To remove Oracle Backend for Spring Boot, navigate to **Developer Services** then **Resource Manager - Stacks** in the Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure Console (OCI Console) main menu. Ensure that you are in the correct region and compartment where you installed the Oracle
Backend as a Service (OBaaS).

Click on the link to open the detailed view for the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot instance and click **Destroy** to clean up resources.
For example:

<!-- spellchecker-disable -->
{{< img name="oci-stack-destroy" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
<!-- spellchecker-enable -->

The OCI Resource Manager uses the stack definition to destroy all resources. For example:

<!-- spellchecker-disable -->
{{< img name="oci-stack-destroy-logs" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
<!-- spellchecker-enable -->

The destroy job takes about 20 minutes to complete. Review the logs when the job is done to ensure that it completed successfully. If there are
any errors, run the **Destroy** job again.

Next, go to the [Release Notes](../release-notes/) page to learn more.
