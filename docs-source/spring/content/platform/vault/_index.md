Oracle Backend as a Service for Spring Cloud includes [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) to secure, store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.

## Vault Architecture and Setup

Vault uses the following Oracle OCI Services:

- Object Storage
- OCI Vault
- OKE

The Vault service has the following enabled:
TBD

## Accessing Vault using using kubectl

1. To access Vault using kubectl you need to setup [Kubernetes Access](../../cluster-access/_index.md)

2. Install the Vault client using these instructions [Install Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/downloads). **NOTE** Installing the server part is not required to access Vault.

3. Expose the Vault Server using `port-forward`

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n vault svc/vault 8200:8200
    ```

4. Test access to Vault

    [Vault Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs) contains all the commands you can use with the Vault CLI. For  example this command returns the current status of Vault:

    ```shell
    kubectl exec pod/vault-0 -n vault  -it -- vault status
    ```

    The output will be similar to this:

    ```text
    Key                      Value
    ---                      -----
    Recovery Seal Type       shamir
    Initialized              true
    Sealed                   false
    Total Recovery Shares    5
    Threshold                3
    Version                  1.11.3
    Build Date               2022-08-26T10:27:10Z
    Storage Type             oci
    Cluster Name             vault-cluster-28535f69
    Cluster ID               993662ee-b3ee-2a13-3354-97adae01e1ca
    HA Enabled               true
    HA Cluster               https://vault-0.vault-internal:8201
    HA Mode                  active
    Active Since             2023-01-26T16:14:32.628291153Z
    ```

5. Login into Vault

    To interact with vault you need to login using a token.

    ```shell
    kubectl exec pod/vault-0 -n vault  -it -- vault login
    Token (will be hidden):
    ```

    Sample output from logging in as the `root` user which only should be done initial setup. As an administrator you **must** generate separate tokens and ACLs for the users than needs access to Vault. See [Vault Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs). The `root` token is provided after successful deployment.

    ```text
    Key                  Value
    ---                  -----
    token                hvs.......
    token_accessor       Hcx.......
    token_duration       âˆž
    token_renewable      false
    token_policies       ["root"]
    identity_policies    []
    policies             ["root"]
    ```

## Accessing Vault using the Web User Interface

1. Expose the Vault Web User Interface using `port-forward`

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n vault svc/vault 8200:8200
    ```

2. Open the Vault Web User Interface: <https://localhost:8200>

    <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
    {{< img name="vault-login" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
    <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

    Login using a token. The `root` token is provided after successful deployment.
