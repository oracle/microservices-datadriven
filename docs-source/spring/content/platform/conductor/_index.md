Oracle Backend for Spring Boot includes Netflix Conductor along with the Netflix Conductor UI.
Conductor is a popular workflow solution that works well with Spring Boot microservices and the Oracle database.

Full documentation on Conductor can be found here:

* [Netflix Conductor Documentation](https://conductor.netflix.com/)

### Accessing Conductor UI

1. Expose the Oracle Spring Cloud Admin Server that the CLI will call by using `port-forward`

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward services/conductor-ui -n conductor-ui  5000:5000
    ```

2. Access the Conductor UI.

    ```shell
    http://localhost:5000
    ```

### Using Conductor UI

The UI can be used to view and exercise workflows.

Workflows consist of tasks and Spring Boot microservices can be called as/from tasks in order to participate in these workflows.
* [Conductor Task Documentation](https://conductor.netflix.com/configuration/taskdef.html) 

The UI can also be used to view these tasks.
