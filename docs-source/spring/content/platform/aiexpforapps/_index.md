## Oracle AI Optimizer and Toolkit

Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI Version 1.4.0 introduces [Oracle AI Optimizer and Toolkit](https://github.com/oracle-samples/ai-optimizer).  

The Oracle AI Optimizer and Toolkit provides a streamlined environment where developers and data scientists can explore the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. By integrating Oracle Database 23ai AI Vector Search, the Sandbox enables users to enhance existing Large Language Models (LLMs) through RAG.

It provides a n environment for experimentation and iteration, allowing you to easily optimize a chatbot/RAG use case by exploring different models, chunking strategies, vector similarity algorithms, prompts, model parameters, memory, re-ranking, and evaluation.
