[Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org) is an open-source cloud native API platform that supports the full lifecycle of API management including publishing,
traffic management, deployment strategies, and circuit breakers.

## Deploy and Secure Sample Application APIs using Apache APISIX

Oracle Backend for Spring Boot deploys APISIX Gateway and Dashboard in the `apisix` namespace. The gateway is exposed through the external load balancer and
ingress controller.  To access the APISIX Dashboard, you must use the `kubectl port-forward` command to create a secure channel to `service/apisix-dashboard`.

1. To expose the Apache APISIX Dashboard using `port-forward`, run this command:

    ```shell
    kubectl port-forward -n apisix svc/apisix-dashboard 8080:80
    ```

2. Open the Apache APISIX Dashboard URL: <http://localhost:8080>

    * username: `admin`
    * password: `admin`

    **Note:** Oracle recommends that you change the default password when you first login.  Even though the dashboard is not accessible externally,
    Oracle still recommends using strong passwords to maximize security.

## Exposing a Spring Application Through the API Gateway and Load Balancer

Once you have your application deployed and running, you may want to expose it to the outside world. Some applications may not need to be
exposed if they are only called by other applications in the platform.
To expose your application, create a "route" in the Apache APISIX API Gateway by processing these steps:

1. Create a route to the service. For example:

    a. In the APISIX Dashboard, click on the **Routes** option in the menu on the left hand side.

      <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
      {{< img name="obaas-apisix-routes" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
      <!-- spellchecker-enable -->

    b. Click **Create** to create a new route.
    
	c. Fill out the necessary details (anything not mentioned here can be left at the default value). For example, for the "slow service"
       to be included in the [sample apps](../../sample-apps), provide these details:
	   
      * name = slow
      * path = /fruit*
      * method = get, options
      * upstream type = service discovery
      * discovery type = eureka
      * service name = SLOW (note that this is case sensitive, this is the key from the Eureka dashboard)

        **NOTE:** The API Gateway is pre-configured with both "Eureka" and "Kubernetes" discovery types.  For Eureka, the service name is the key used to
		          deploy the service in Eureka, which is normally the value from `spring.application.name` in the Spring Boot configuration
				  file (`src/main/resources/application.yaml`), in uppercase characters.  For Kubernetes, the service name is in the
				  format `namespace/service:port` where `namespace` is the Kubernetes namespace in which the Spring Boot application is deployed, `service` is
				  the name of the Kubernetes service for that application, and `port` is the name of the port in that service.  If you deployed your Spring Boot
				  application with the Oracle Backend for Spring Boot CLI, the port name will be `spring`.  For example, an application called `slow-service` deployed
				  in the `my-apps` namespace would be `my-apps/slow-service:spring`.

        <!-- spellchecker-enable -->
        </br>
        <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
        {{< img name="obaas-apisix-routes-step2" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
        <!-- spellchecker-enable -->
        </br>
        <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
        {{< img name="obaas-apisix-routes-step3" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
        <!-- spellchecker-enable -->
        </br>

    d. Save the route that you created.
        <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
        {{< img name="obaas-apisix-routes-step4" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
        <!-- spellchecker-enable -->
        </br>
        <!-- spellchecker-disable -->
        {{< img name="obaas-apisix-routes-step5" size="medium" lazy=false >}}
        <!-- spellchecker-enable -->
        </br>

2. Test a route to the service. For example:

    a. Get the APISIX Gateway external IP using this command:

        ```shell
        kubectl -n ingress-nginx get svc ingress-nginx-controller
        ```

    b. Call the API using the APISIX Gateway address plus path. For example:

        ```shell
        curl http://APISIX_IP/fruit
        ```

      You should get "banana" or "fallback fruit is apple" back as the response.
