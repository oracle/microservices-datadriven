[Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org) is an open source cloud native API platform that supports the full lifecycle of API management including publishing, traffic management, deployment strategies, and circuit breakers.

## Installing APISIX

Apache APISIX will be installed if the `apisix.enabled` is set to `true` in the `values.yaml` file. The default namespace for Apache APISIX is `apisix`.

## Accessing Apache APISIX

Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI deploys the Apache APISIX Gateway and Dashboard in the `apisix` namespace by default. The gateway is exposed via an external load balancer and an ingress controller.

To access the Apache APISIX APIs, use kubectl port-forward to create a secure channel to `service/apisix-admin`. Run the following command to establish the secure tunnel (replace the example namespace `obaas-dev` with the namespace where APISIX is deployed):

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n obaas-dev svc/apisix-admin 9180
```

## Retrieving admin key

To access the APISIX APIs, you need the admin key. Retrieve it with the following command (replace the example namespace `obaas-dev` with the namespace where APISIX is deployed):

**Option 1 - Using yq:**

```bash
kubectl -n obaas-dev get configmap apisix -o yaml | yq '.data."config.yaml"' | yq '.deployment.admin.admin_key[] | select(.name == "admin") | .key'
```

**Option 2 - Manual retrieval:**

If the command above doesn't work:

1. Run: `kubectl get configmap apisix -n obaas-dev -o yaml`
1. Look for the `config.yaml` section
1. Find `deployment.admin.admin_key` and copy the key value

Test the admin key by running a simple curl command; it should return the list of configured routes.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes -H "X-API-key: $admin_key" -X GET
```

## Accessing APISIX Dashboard

:::note
 Note that all functionality is not available in the dashboard. You might need to use the REST APIs
:::

APISIX has an embedded dashboard that can be accessed after a tunnel is established to the `apisix-admin` service. The dashboard is available on [http://localhost:8190/ui](http://localhost:8190/ui). **NOTE:** you need the Admin key to be able to access the dashboard.

## Configuring APISIX using REST APIs

You can configure and update the APISIX gateway using the provided APIs.  Pleas refer to the [API Documentation](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/getting-started/README/) for detailed information.

## Using custom plugins

You can install custom plugins in APISIS using the Helm charts.

First, add an `extraConfigMaps` section to the `values.yaml` file that you use with the `obaas` Helm chart.  This will allow you
to create extra arbitrary Config Maps in your cluster as part of the OBaaS installation.  In this config map, add one key (data item)
for each plugin, and include the Lua code for the plugin, as shown in the example below.  You may list as many custom plugins as desired.

```yaml
# ConfigMaps created by the parent chart 
# Each top-level key becomes a ConfigMap name, with nested keys as data entries 
extraConfigMaps: 
  apisix-custom-plugin: 
    abd.lua: | 
      local core = require("apisix.core") 
      
      local plugin_name = "abd" 
      
      local _M = { 
          version = 0.1, 
          priority = 2500, 
          name = plugin_name, 
          schema = {} 
      } 
      
      function _M.access(conf, ctx) 
          core.log.warn("ABD plugin executed") 
      end 
      
      return _M 
    xyz.lua: | 
      local core = require("apisix.core") 
      
      local plugin_name = "xyz" 
      
      local _M = { 
          version = 0.1, 
          priority = 2501, 
          name = plugin_name, 
          schema = {} 
      } 
      
      function _M.access(conf, ctx) 
           core.log.info("XYZ plugin executed") 
      end 
      
      return _M 
```

Next, in the `apisix` section, add a `customPlugins` section to configure the plugins, here is an example that loads the two plugins defined above:

```yaml
# custom plugin 
apisix:
  apisix:
    customPlugins: 
      enabled: true 
      luaPath: "/opts/custom_plugins/?.lua" 
      plugins: 
        - name: "abd" 
          attrs: {} 
          configMap: 
            name: "apisix-custom-plugin" 
            mounts: 
              - key: "abd.lua" 
                path: "/opts/custom_plugins/apisix/plugins/abd.lua" 
        - name: "xyz" 
          attrs: {} 
          configMap: 
            name: "apisix-custom-plugin" 
            mounts: 
              - key: "xyz.lua" 
                path: "/opts/custom_plugins/apisix/plugins/xyz.lua"
```

:::note
 Note that the luaPath does not contain the “apisix/plugins” part because APISIX will automatically add that when it searches for the plugin source code files.
:::

After you have deployed OBaaS, you can access the APISIX admin service to create a route and attach your plugins to the route. Here is an example of a route that uses the `abd` plugin from the example above:

```json
{
  "list": [
    {
      "key": "/apisix/routes/00000000000000000076",
      "value": {
        "uri": "/test-plugin*",
        "methods": [
          "GET"
        ],
        "plugins": {
          "abd": {}
        },
        "update_time": 1772900293,
        "upstream": {
          "discovery_type": "eureka",
          "pass_host": "pass",
          "scheme": "http",
          "hash_on": "vars",
          "tls": {
            "verify": false
          },
          "service_name": "CONFIG-SERVER",
          "type": "roundrobin"
        },
        "priority": 0,
        "id": "00000000000000000076",
        "status": 1,
        "name": "abc",
        "enable_websocket": false,
        "create_time": 1772899208
      },
      "modifiedIndex": 96,
      "createdIndex": 77
    }
  ],
  "total": 1
}
```

You can then hit the uri in the route to test it, for example:

```bash
curl http://IP_ADDRESS:8080/test-plugin/1

{"name":"test-plugin","profiles":["1"],"label":null,"version":null,"state":null,"propertySources":[]}
```

You can check the APISIX pod log to confirm the plugin was executed, in this example by verifying you see the HTTP GET and also the `ADB plugin executed` message that the plugin printed:

```
2026/03/07 16:18:31 [warn] 56#56: *38964 [lua] abd.lua:13: phase_func(): ABD plugin executed, client: 127.0.0.1, server: _, request: "GET /test-plugin/1 HTTP/1.1", host: "localhost:8080" 
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Mar/2026:16:18:31 +0000] localhost:8080 "GET /test-plugin/1 HTTP/1.1" 200 112 0.021 "-" "curl/7.81.0" 10.42.0.48:8080 200 0.022 "http://localhost:8080"
```

:::note
 Note that you do not need to list your custom plugins in the `apisix.apisix.plugins` list in the `values.yaml` for the `obaas` Helm chart, APISIX will automatically
 add your custom plugins to its configuration.
