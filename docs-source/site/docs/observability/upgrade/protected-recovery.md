# Upgrade to SigNoZ 0.134.0 with protected recovery

This is the recommended upgrade procedure. It uses two Helm commands. Stage 1
creates retained Kubernetes CSI snapshots and upgrades ClickHouse. Stage 2
upgrades SigNoZ and runs its telemetry migrations only after validating the
Stage 1 result.

## When to use this guide

Use this guide for production environments and whenever historical telemetry,
dashboards, users, or ClickHouse data must remain recoverable.

## Prerequisites

Add and update the released OBaaS Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add obaas https://oracle.github.io/microservices-backend/helm
helm repo update
```

Confirm that:

- The existing release uses SigNoZ, ClickHouse, and ZooKeeper persistent
  volumes.
- The storage CSI driver supports Kubernetes `VolumeSnapshot` resources.
- A compatible `VolumeSnapshotClass` exists or can be created.
- Provider backup limits and budget can accommodate complete snapshots of all
  protected volumes.
- The same customer values, database settings, secret names, image settings,
  and other overrides are available for both stages.

Download the versioned OBaaS helper scripts. A source checkout is not required:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade

curl --fail --location \
  --output /tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/prepare-oke-volume-snapshots.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/microservices-backend/OBAAS-2.1.1/helm/infra-charts/tools/prepare-oke-volume-snapshots.sh
curl --fail --location \
  --output /tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/validate-signoz-snapshot-restore.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/microservices-backend/OBAAS-2.1.1/helm/infra-charts/tools/validate-signoz-snapshot-restore.sh
curl --fail --location \
  --output /tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/diagnose-signoz-upgrade.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/microservices-backend/OBAAS-2.1.1/helm/infra-charts/tools/diagnose-signoz-upgrade.sh

chmod +x /tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/*.sh
```

Replace all placeholders in the following commands with values for the existing
release.

## Step-by-step procedure

### 1. Record the current environment

```bash
kubectl config current-context
helm status <app-release> -n <application-namespace>
kubectl get pods,pvc -n <application-namespace>

helm get values <app-release> -n <application-namespace> -o yaml \
  > /tmp/obaas-pre-signoz-upgrade-values.yaml
helm get manifest <app-release> -n <application-namespace> \
  > /tmp/obaas-pre-signoz-upgrade-manifest.yaml
```

Confirm that SigNoZ, ClickHouse, and ZooKeeper are healthy. Record an
identifiable historical telemetry time range for post-upgrade validation.

### 2. Prepare volume snapshots

#### OKE with OCI Block Volume

Prepare each OKE cluster once:

```bash
/tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/prepare-oke-volume-snapshots.sh \
  --namespace <application-namespace> \
  --release <app-release>
```

The script installs pinned Kubernetes VolumeSnapshot CRDs, creates the
non-default `obaas-oci-bv-snapshot` class, and validates the SigNoZ, ClickHouse,
and ZooKeeper PVCs. The class uses the OCI Block Volume CSI driver, full
backups, and `deletionPolicy: Retain`.

Validate an already prepared cluster without changing it:

```bash
/tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/prepare-oke-volume-snapshots.sh \
  --namespace <application-namespace> \
  --release <app-release> \
  --check-only
```

Kubernetes VolumeSnapshots do not require a backup size. OCI backs up each
complete source Block Volume. Review the protected PVC capacities and verify
that OCI Block Volume Backup service limits and budget can accommodate them.

#### Other Kubernetes providers

Install the provider-supported snapshot CRDs, common snapshot controller, CSI
snapshot implementation, and `VolumeSnapshotClass`. Verify that the snapshot
class uses the same CSI driver as the SigNoZ PVCs. Do not use the OKE
preparation script with a non-OCI storage driver.

### 3. Run Stage 1

For OKE:

```bash
helm upgrade <app-release> obaas/obaas \
  --version 0.1.1 \
  -n <application-namespace> \
  --timeout 30m \
  -f <customer-values-file> \
  --set signozUpgrade.stage=stage1 \
  --set signozUpgrade.backup.volumeSnapshotClassName=obaas-oci-bv-snapshot \
  --set signoz.signoz.image.tag=v0.113.0 \
  --set signoz.otelCollector.image.tag=v0.144.1 \
  --set signoz.telemetryStoreMigrator.enabled=false \
  --set signoz.clickhouse.image.tag=25.12.5
```

For another Kubernetes provider:

```bash
helm upgrade <app-release> obaas/obaas \
  --version 0.1.1 \
  -n <application-namespace> \
  --timeout 30m \
  -f <customer-values-file> \
  --set signozUpgrade.stage=stage1 \
  --set signozUpgrade.backup.volumeSnapshotClassName=<snapshot-class-name> \
  --set signoz.signoz.image.tag=v0.113.0 \
  --set signoz.otelCollector.image.tag=v0.144.1 \
  --set signoz.telemetryStoreMigrator.enabled=false \
  --set signoz.clickhouse.image.tag=25.12.5
```

Stage 1:

1. Invalidates any earlier completion marker.
1. Creates retained snapshots for the SigNoZ, ClickHouse, and ZooKeeper PVCs.
1. Waits for every snapshot to become ready.
1. Upgrades ClickHouse to `25.12.5`.
1. Validates the running ClickHouse version and original PVC identities.
1. Records a completion marker for Stage 2.

Do not continue until the following checks pass:

```bash
kubectl get volumesnapshots -n <application-namespace>
/tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/diagnose-signoz-upgrade.sh \
  <application-namespace> <app-release>
```

Every snapshot must report `readyToUse: true`, ClickHouse must be healthy, and
the diagnostics must show a complete Stage 1 marker.

### 4. Validate the ClickHouse restore point

Prove that the newest ClickHouse snapshot can provision a new volume and that
the restored volume contains recognizable ClickHouse data:

```bash
NAMESPACE=<application-namespace> \
RELEASE_NAME=<app-release> \
/tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/validate-signoz-snapshot-restore.sh
```

This smoke test creates a temporary PVC, mounts it read-only, and retains it for
inspection. It does not mount or change the live ClickHouse PVC. The restore
PVC size is selected automatically from the snapshot's `status.restoreSize`.
Run the cleanup commands printed by the script after inspection.

Do not continue to Stage 2 if restore validation fails.

### 5. Run Stage 2

```bash
helm upgrade <app-release> obaas/obaas \
  --version 0.1.1 \
  -n <application-namespace> \
  --timeout 30m \
  -f <customer-values-file> \
  --set signozUpgrade.stage=stage2
```

Before modifying workloads, the Stage 2 gate verifies the completion marker,
ClickHouse version, original PVC identities, and retained snapshots. It then
upgrades SigNoZ and the collector, runs telemetry migrations, removes obsolete
resources, runs the OBaaS SigNoZ setup, and validates historical and newly
ingested telemetry rows.

## Validation

```bash
kubectl get pods,jobs -n <application-namespace>
/tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/diagnose-signoz-upgrade.sh \
  <application-namespace> <app-release>
```

Confirm:

- SigNoZ is running `v0.134.0`.
- The SigNoZ collector is running `v0.144.6`.
- ClickHouse is running `25.12.5`.
- The telemetry-store migrator and SigNoZ setup Jobs completed.
- Existing users can sign in.
- Existing dashboards remain available.
- Telemetry from before Stage 1 is visible.
- New metrics, logs, and traces are ingested.

Keep the Stage 1 snapshots through the customer's upgrade and recovery window.
They are retained independently of Helm and may incur storage charges.

For OKE, inventory both Kubernetes objects and OCI backup handles:

```bash
kubectl get volumesnapshots -n <application-namespace>
kubectl get volumesnapshotcontents \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,POLICY:.spec.deletionPolicy,HANDLE:.status.snapshotHandle'
```

Remove snapshots and retained provider backups only under the customer's backup
retention policy.

## Rollback and recovery

ClickHouse upgrades its on-disk format in place, so an automatic downgrade is
not guaranteed. Do not start an older ClickHouse version against the upgraded
live PVC.

If Stage 1 or Stage 2 fails:

1. Stop and retain the live PVCs, VolumeSnapshots, and provider backup handles.
1. Do not continue to Stage 2 when the Stage 1 marker or restore validation is
   incomplete.
1. Collect the diagnostics described below.
1. Follow the storage provider's procedure to create replacement volumes from
   the retained snapshots. OKE restores a snapshot into a new Block Volume; it
   does not revert an existing PVC in place.
1. Validate restored data before reconnecting workloads.

The chart does not automatically replace live PVCs during recovery. Preserve
the original resources and contact Oracle Support before rebinding restored
volumes in a production environment.

## Troubleshooting

Collect read-only diagnostics:

```bash
/tmp/obaas-signoz-upgrade/diagnose-signoz-upgrade.sh \
  <application-namespace> <app-release>
```

Stage 2 stops before changing workloads when its marker, version, PVC, or
snapshot checks fail. Correct the reported condition; do not bypass the gate by
manually creating or editing the completion marker.
