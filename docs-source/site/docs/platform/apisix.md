## Apache APISIX

[Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org) is an open source cloud native API platform that supports the full lifecycle of API management including publishing, traffic management, deployment strategies, and circuit breakers.

### Installing APISIX

Apache APISIX will be installed if the `apisix.enabled` is set to `true` in the `values.yaml` file. The default namespace for Apache APISIX is `apisix`.

### Accessing Apache APISIX

Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI deploys the Apache APISIX Gateway and Dashboard in the `apisix` namespace by default. The gateway is exposed via an external load balancer and an ingress controller.

To access the Apache APISIX APIs, use kubectl port-forward to create a secure channel to `service/apisix-admin`. Run the following command to establish the secure tunnel (replace the example namespace `obaas-dev` with the namespace where APISIX is deployed):

```shell
kubectl port-forward -n obaas-dev svc/apisix-admin 9180
```

### Retrieving admin key

To access the APISIX APIs, you need the admin key. Retrieve it with the following command (replace the example namespace `obaas-dev` with the namespace where APISIX is deployed):

**Option 1 - Using yq:**

```bash
kubectl -n obaas-dev get configmap apisix -o yaml | yq '.data."config.yaml"' | yq '.deployment.admin.admin_key[] | select(.name == "admin") | .key'
```

**Option 2 - Manual retrieval:**

If the command above doesn't work:

1. Run: `kubectl get configmap apisix -n obaas-dev -o yaml`
1. Look for the `config.yaml` section
1. Find `deployment.admin.admin_key` and copy the key value

Test the admin key by running a simple curl command; it should return the list of configured routes.

```shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:9180/apisix/admin/routes -H "X-API-key: $admin_key" -X GET
```

### Accessing APISIX Dashboard

:::note
 Note that all functionality is not available in the dashboard. You might need to use the REST APIs
:::

APISIX has an embedded dashboard that can be accessed after a tunnel is established to the `apisix-admin` service. The dashboard is available on this [URL](http://localhost:8190/ui). **NOTE:** you need the Admin key to be able to access the dashboard.

### Configuring APISIX using REST APIs

You can configure and update the APISIX gateway using the provided APIs. [API Documentation](https://apisix.apache.org/docs/apisix/getting-started/README/)
