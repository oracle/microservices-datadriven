# Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI

## Accelerate Your Journey to Cloud-Native Applications

Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI (OBaaS) is a comprehensive platform that transforms how developers build, deploy, and scale modern applications. By combining the power of Oracle Database with a complete microservices infrastructure, OBaaS eliminates the complexity of cloud-native development and empowers teams to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.

## Build Faster, Scale Smarter

Whether you're building with Helidon, Spring Boot, or integrating AI capabilities, OBaaS provides a production-ready "backend as a service" that handles the heavy lifting. Deploy across multiple clouds with confidence, knowing that your platform is built on proven Oracle technology designed for enterprise-grade reliability, security, and performance.

## Why Choose Oracle Backend for Microservices and AI?

### Developer Experience First

Write code in your preferred framework - Helidon or Spring Boot - while OBaaS handles service discovery, configuration management, API gateways, and data persistence. Spend less time configuring infrastructure and more time building features that matter to your business.

### Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure

Built on Oracle Database and designed for mission-critical workloads, OBaaS provides:

- **Reliability**: High availability and disaster recovery built in
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security controls and compliance
- **Scalability**: Elastic scaling to meet demand automatically
- **Performance**: Optimized for low latency and high throughput

### AI-Ready Platform

Leverage the power of Oracle AI Database 26ai to integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning directly into your applications. Build intelligent services that learn and adapt without the complexity of managing separate AI infrastructure.

### Multi-Cloud Flexibility

Deploy on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, other cloud providers, or hybrid environments. OBaaS provides consistent operations and portability across clouds, giving you freedom from vendor lock-in.

### Simplified Operations

OBaaS vastly simplifies the task of building, testing, and operating microservices platforms. From development through production, automated workflows and integrated tooling streamline every phase of the application lifecycle.

## Get Started

Ready to try OBaaS? Choose your path:

- **[Setup with Helm or OCI Marketplace →](./setup/index.md)** — Install the platform on your Kubernetes cluster
- **[Deploy an Application →](./deploy/overview.md)** — Deploy your microservices to an existing OBaaS installation
