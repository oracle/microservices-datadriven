# Simplify Microservices Architecture with Oracle AI Database

This repository contains sample code for simplifying microservices architectures by building solution examples for data-driven microservices that walk you through the creation of an open platform technology stack with the converged [Oracle Autonomous AI Database][ATP] including relational, JSON, text, spatial and graph data and using polyglot languages including Java and the Helidon MP and SE frameworks, Python and JavaScript via Node.js

Microservices are loosely-coupled service-oriented architectures with a bounded context. Microservices are increasingly used for application modernization to deliver agile application development practices. However, the data-driven nature of enterprise applications has made building, deploying, and maintaining microservices complex.
