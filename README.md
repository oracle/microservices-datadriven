# Simplify microservices architecture with Oracle Converged Database

This repository contains sample code for simplifying microservices architectures
by building solution examples for data-driven microservices that walk you through
the creation of an open platform technology stack with the converged
[Oracle Autonomous Database][ATP] including relational, JSON, text, spatial and
graph data and using polyglot languages including Java and the Helidon MP and SE
frameworks, Python and JavaScript via Node.js

Microservices are loosely-coupled service-oriented architectures with a bounded
context. Microservices are increasingly used for application modernization to
deliver agile application development practices. However, the data-driven nature
of enterprise applications has made building, deploying, and maintaining
microservices complex.
